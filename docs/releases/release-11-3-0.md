The repository has the structure of an **Angular Workspace**. It is composed of two Angular libraries, **@sinequa/core** and **@sinequa/components** and two Angular applications using these libraries, **Hello Search** and **Vanilla Search**. Vanilla Search is a modern sample of Enterprise Search application including many features of Sinequa, which can be used as is, or as the starting point for a new project.

We recommend **cloning** or **forking** this repository, and developing your own app within this clone/fork. By doing so, updating your workspace can be easily done by **pulling** from this repository.
