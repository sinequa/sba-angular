# Auditing applications

In Sinequa, Search-Based Applications can be "audited": User actions (queries, clicks, etc.) are collected and stored server-side to allow admins to study the usage of their applications and the behavior of users. This is a very important process to optimize the search relevance and user experience.

## Prerequisites

On the server, several prerequisites are necessary:

- The creation of an audit index.
- The creation of jobs to process the audit logs and update the audit index.
- In the web app's configuration, specify which actions should be collected:

    ![Audit webapp]({{site.baseurl}}assets/tipstricks/audit-webapp.png){: .d-block .mx-auto }

## Standard Events

By default, Sinequa components take care of emitting audit events when needed. For example, the `SearchService` emits events when the user searches for some text and the `FacetService` emits events when they select a metadata in a facet.

This can happen in two ways:

- Normally, these audit events are emitted by "piggy-backing" on the web service HTTP call corresponding to the audited user action.
- Alternatively, stand-alone audit events can be emitted via the `AuditWebService`.

### Audit events via standard web service calls

Sinequa Web Services accept an optional `$auditRecord` parameter that is used to write events to the audit logs.

For example, in the `QueryWebService`, the web service call looks as follows:

```ts
const observable = this.httpClient.post<Results>(this.makeUrl(this.endPoint), {
    app: this.appName,
    query,
    $auditRecord: auditEvents,
    queryIntentData
});
```

Note that the `$auditRecord` field is supported across **all** web services, including the custom ones (in particular `JsonMethodPlugin`).

### Audit events via the audit web service

The `AuditWebService` is a standard Sinequa service that can be injected anywhere in your application to emit "standalone" audit events.

For example, it is used to emit events when users open a document (by following its original URL) in the `SearchService`:

```ts
this.auditService.notifyDocument(
    AuditEventType.Click_ResultLink,
    record,
    results || resultId || "",
    {
        querytext: this.query.text,
        querylang,
    },
    {
        queryhash: results ? results.rfmQueryHash : undefined,
        querytext: this.query.text,
        querylang: querylang
    }
);
```

## Custom Events

Audit events are not limited to a predefined list of event types or a predefined content. It is possible to create new types of events and customize their structure.

The `AuditEvent` interface is very flexible as it requires:

- A `type`, which can be a standard type (among those listed in the `AuditEventType`) or a custom `string`.
- A `detail` field, which is a simple key-value map, where the keys correspond to columns of the audit index (of course, these columns must exist in the audit index schema, which can be customized).

    ![Audit schema]({{site.baseurl}}assets/tipstricks/audit-schema.png){: .d-block .mx-auto }

Therefore, emitting a custom standalone event is as simple as the following example:

```ts
this.auditWebService.notify({
    type: "ResultsView_Change",
    detail: {
        view: this.resultsViewService.resultsView.name
    }
});
```

## Customizing standard events

It is often required to add some custom data to a standard event (or even to *all* standard events). One solution to that problem would be to modify (or override) the existing services (`SearchService`, `FacetService`, etc.), to add the missing data. But this approach is cumbersome and requires more maintenance.

A better alternative is to *intercept* audit events globally (just before they are sent to the server) and modify them all in this centralized location. This can be achieved by extending the standard `AuditInterceptor` and overriding the `updateAuditRecord()` method.

[HTTP interceptors](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpInterceptor) are a standard way to manipulate HTTP requests and responses globally in Angular. Sinequa includes an interceptor dedicated to audit events. It is provided by default in application samples, such as [Vanilla Search]({{site.baseurl}}apps/2-vanilla-search.html), in the `app.module.ts` file:

```ts
@NgModule({
    ...,
    providers: [
        ...
        // Provides an HttpInterceptor that offers a centralized location through which all client-side
        // audit records pass. An application can replace AuditInterceptor with a subclass that overrides
        // the updateAuditRecord method to add custom audit information to the records.
        {provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuditInterceptor, multi: true},
```

You can replace this standard interceptor with your custom version:

```ts
{provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: MyAuditInterceptor, multi: true},
```

This custom interceptor should extend the original version and override the `updateAuditRecord()` method. In the example below, we modify specifically the `Search_Text` audit events to include the query web service's name in the `detail` object.

```ts
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { AuditInterceptor } from '@sinequa/core/app-utils';
import { AuditRecord, StartConfig, START_CONFIG, AuditEventType } from '@sinequa/core/web-services';
import { SearchService } from '@sinequa/components/search';

@Injectable({
    providedIn: "root"
})
export class MyAuditInterceptor extends AuditInterceptor {

    constructor(
        @Inject(START_CONFIG) startConfig: StartConfig,
        public searchService: SearchService){
        super(startConfig);
    }

    protected updateAuditRecord(auditRecord?: AuditRecord) {
        auditRecord?.auditEvents?.forEach(event => {
            if(event.type === AuditEventType.Search_Text && event.detail) {
                event.detail.queryWS = this.searchService.query.name;
            }
        });
    }
}
```
