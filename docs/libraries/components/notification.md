# Notification Module

## Features

This module introduces the Bootstrap-flavored components to display and manage user notifications.

For the creation and management of notifications, please refer to the Core Notification module.

![Error notification]({{site.baseurl}}assets/modules/notification/notification-error-notification-example.png)
*An error notification*
{: .text-center }

## Import

```typescript
import { BsNotificationModule } from "@sinequa/components/notification";

@NgModule({
  imports: [
      /*....*/
      BsNotificationModule,
      /*....*/
  ],
  /*....*/
})
```

This module is internationalized: If not already the case, you need to import its messages for the language(s) of your application. For example, in your app's `src/locales/en.ts`:

```ts
...
import {enNotification} from "@sinequa/components/notification";

const messages = Utils.merge({}, ..., enNotification, appMessages);
```
