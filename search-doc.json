Our platform is deployed on four continents, and the company has offices in New York, Paris, San Francisco, London, and Frankfurt.  Sinequa excels at searching and extracting information from unstructured data (like text in natural language from documents and files). However, Sinequa can be readily process large amounts of both structured and unstructured data, enabling many use cases in large and complex organizations across industries. These use cases include, but are not limited to, Enterprise Search (An enterprise-wide smart search engine that includes many heterogeneous sources of content and tens of millions of documents), 360° Views (An application that retrieves all relevant information about a product, person or any other entity across heterogenous and unstructured data sources), and more specialized applications (e.g., GDPR compliance, contract analysis, customer support portal, data loss prevention, pharmaceutical R&amp;D, etc.).  The platform integrates proprietary and open-source technologies to deliver top performance and relevance in Search, Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. We provide rich and extensible User Interfaces with our Angular-based SBA framework. We release this framework as open source to give our customers more flexibility and to foster a worldwide community of developers.

Below a snippet of the Home page template (html)  &lt;uib-zone id=&quot;home&quot;&gt; ... &lt;ng-template uib-template=&quot;search-form&quot; display=&quot;Search form&quot; let-config&gt; &lt;app-search-form [autocompleteSources]=&quot;config.autocompleteSources&quot;&gt;&lt;/app-search-form&gt; &lt;/ng-template&gt; ... &lt;/uib-zone&gt;   Here a zone called home is set. Inside this zone, a uib-directive called search-form is set. Now, the ui-builder library knows the app-search-form component can be customized. As you can notice in this example, app-search-form is not a SBA component: indeed, the uib-builder can be used with any kind of components.  Now, take a look at the home configuration object:  { id: 'home', type: '_container', classes: 'd-flex align-items-center flex-column w-100', items: ['home-logo', 'home-title', 'search-form', 'home-actions', 'home-facets'] }   This configuration is associated with the uib-zone with the id home. So, this describes the zone:  the zone is a container (type: '_container')the zone contains various components (items: [...]). Each component within this array will be rendered by index order.class is just for css styling the host element  In the items property, you can notice the search-form id. This tells the ui-builder library to render a component whose id is search-form  Let's see what this component is... The template (html) gives us the answer:   &lt;ng-template uib-template=&quot;search-form&quot; display=&quot;Search form&quot; let-config&gt; &lt;app-search-form [autocompleteSources]=&quot;config.autocompleteSources&quot;&gt;&lt;/app-search-form&gt; &lt;/ng-template&gt;   search-component is an app-search-form component.  Take a look at it's configuration object:  { id: 'search-form', type: 'search-form', classes: 'col-8 col-md-7 col-lg-5 col-xl-4 app-search-form px-2', autocompleteSources: ['suggests','baskets','recent-documents','recent-queries','saved-queries'], enableVoiceRecognition: true, keepTab: true, enableKeepFilters: true, keepFilters: true, enableAdvancedForm: true, keepAdvancedSearchFilters: true }   All properties after classes are the component's inputs default values. If you want keep some inputs not configurable, do not include them in the configuration.  Now, to allow an user to customize this values, you need to set a configurator. Configurators are all set inside a special HTML tag: &lt;uib-configurator&gt;&lt;/uib-configurator&gt;  In our example, the configutor's template looks like this:  &lt;uib-configurator&gt; ... &lt;ng-template uib-template=&quot;search-form&quot; let-context&gt; &lt;sq-search-form-legacy-configurator [context]=&quot;context&quot;&gt; &lt;/sq-search-form-legacy-configurator&gt; &lt;/ng-template&gt; ... &lt;/uib-configurator&gt;   Here we tell to the ui-builder which configurator to use with search-form. The context associated is (to be simple) the search-form's configuration object, so the configurator knows how to interact with the component.  Building a configurator is quite easy.  Below the search-form configurator:  import { Component, Input } from &quot;@angular/core&quot;; import { ConfiguratorContext } from &quot;@sinequa/ngx-ui-builder&quot;; @Component({ selector: 'sq-search-form-legacy-configurator', template: ` &lt;h6&gt;Autocomplete sources&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;uib-multi-selector [options]=&quot;sources&quot; valueField=&quot;value&quot; displayField=&quot;display&quot; [(ngModel)]=&quot;context.config.autocompleteSources&quot; (ngModelChange)=&quot;context.configChanged()&quot;&gt; &lt;/uib-multi-selector&gt; ` }) export class SearchFormLegacyConfiguratorComponent { @Input() context: ConfiguratorContext; sources = [ {value: &quot;suggests&quot;, display: &quot;Suggestions&quot;}, {value: &quot;baskets&quot;, display: &quot;Collections (aka. baskets)&quot;}, {value: &quot;recent-documents&quot;, display: &quot;Recent documents&quot;}, {value: &quot;recent-queries&quot;, display: &quot;Recent queries&quot;}, {value: &quot;saved-queries&quot;, display: &quot;Saved queries&quot;}, ] }   ui-builder comes with multiple built-in components and configurators ready to use. Here &lt;uib-multi-selector&gt;&lt;/uib-multi-selector&gt; is a kind of checkboxes list.  Configurators are displayed in the ui-builder panel, but while drag'n dropping component inside a uib-zone, those configurators can also be displayed as a modal window.

Widgets cannot talk to each other, but some user interactions (like selecting an area on the map) can trigger a refresh of the global results (which itself triggers a refresh of the widgets).  Similarly, widgets can listen to other types of global events. For example, the SelectionService keeps track of documents selected via their sq-result-selector checkbox (See Selection). If a widget displays a document in one form or another (like a pin on the map), it can update the pin display when the document becomes selected, and conversely select the document when the user clicks on the pin.

This means that the state of the widgets must be persisted.  The dashboard component automatically persists any data stored in the widget.state object. This object is serialized in JSON format and stored in the user preferences.  To persist or not to persist​  Not all of the state needs to be persisted. For example, your custom widget might look like the following:  &lt;my-custom-widget *ngSwitchCase=&quot;'my-custom-type'&quot; [constant]=&quot;'Hello world'&quot; [results]=&quot;results&quot; [parameter]=&quot;widget.parameter&quot; [parameterPersistent]=&quot;widget.state.parameter&quot;&gt; &lt;/my-custom-widget&gt;   This example shows different types of inputs that a widget can have:  Constants: fixed values that are hard-coded or defined in the app configuration.Variables: Values that may change at any time (for example, the results object).Parameters: values defined when the widget is created and stored in the widget object (but lost or recomputed when you refresh the page).Persistent parameters: parameters that are stored in widget.state and persisted in the user settings.  Only the minimum amount of information should be persisted in widget.state. If a complex object can be re-computed based on the state, it is better to do so than to persist it.  For example:  If your component expects a Results object, do not store the Results object in the state. Instead, store the Query object and generate the Results object when the widget is created.If your component expects a Record object, store the id of the record and generate the Record object when the widget is created.  For example, in the standard components, the persisted items include:  For all widgets: Widget size and position in the dashboard.For the preview widget: id of the opened document and the search query yielding that document.For the chart widget: Selected aggregation and chart type.  Initializing the widget​  The definition of the WidgetOption is very important to properly initialize the state. For example:  option = { type: &quot;my-custom-type&quot;, icon: &quot;fas fa-chart-bar&quot;, text: &quot;My custom widget&quot;, ...defaultOptions, state: { param: &quot;Hello world&quot;, }, init: (widget) =&gt; widget.otherParam = createComplexObject(widget), }   In the above example, param is the default state (that can be later modified during the life of the widget). otherParam is a complex object that is generated when the widget is created and does not need to be persisted.  Note that the init method will also be called when the widget is restored from the user preferences to guarantee that otherParam is always defined.  Handling state changes​  If the (persisted) state of your custom widget changes, it should be reflected in the user preferences.  The simplest way to achieve this is to call DashboardComponent.update(widget, state), where state is only a &quot;patch&quot; of the state that has changed.  For example, when the user modifies the chartType property of a chart widget, an event handler is called:  (typeChange)=&quot;dashboardComponent.update(widget, {chartType: $event})&quot;   (In turn, the sq-dashboard component triggers a (changed) event handled by the app-dashboard component, which saves the state in the user preferences.)  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Widget sizing​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Pepper","url":"/sba-angular/docs/apps/pepper#widget-sizing","content":" One difficulty in building widgets is that their size is strongly constrained by the dashboard, so the components cannot take their ideal size. They must be able to adapt to any size (for example, by forcing a width and height of 100% or by scrolling vertically or horizontally) or conform to an explicit size (in pixels) provided by the parent (sq-dashboard) via the widget.width and widget.height properties.  The built-in components behave differently in that respect:  The network's canvas takes the available space using width: 100% and height: 100%.The charts are explicitly resized when the dashboard is initialized or resized.The map's height is bound explicitly (i.e., the width is automatically 100%).The heatmap and timeline are svg-based and are redrawn when resized. Therefore, the width and height are explicitly bound.  For example a custom widget with a fixed size and scrollable content might look like:  &lt;div *ngSwitchCase=&quot;'my-custom-type'&quot; class=&quot;overflow-auto&quot; [ngStyle]=&quot;{ 'height.px': widget.height, 'width.px': widget.width }&quot;&gt; content &lt;/div&gt;   If your component must be redrawn when its size changes, it is likely to need an interface similar to the timeline or heatmap components. Concretely, it will probably require explicit width and height inputs (probably with default values). The ngOnChange() will then catch any change of dimension from the parent and trigger the redrawing:  @Input() width = 600; @Input() height = 400; ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) { if(changes['width'] || changes['height']) { redraw(); } }   The width and height inputs may also be used in the template. For example:  &lt;svg width=&quot;{{width}}&quot; height=&quot;{{height}}&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/svg&gt;  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Contact Us","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sba-angular/docs/contact","content":"Contact Us Interested in Sinequa?

Fortunately, there's an app for that! The Usage Analytics application displays all this information within a set of dashboards. info The SBA standard components and applications have a built-in audit system that records all relevant user actions into logs. These logs can be periodically indexed in an audit index. The Usage Analytics application computes metrics directly based on this data. Modify the application's configuration. Applications can be customized without changing their source code (to some extent). There are three possible ways to achieve this: Customizing the configuration of the application's web services, in particular the query web service. This approach is documented in the server configuration guide.Customizing the application's JSON configuration. Each application has a set of internal settings that can be overridden by adding properties in the &quot;Customization (JSON)&quot; tab of the application. This typically includes the list of facets, metadata, and preview highlights, and it allows certain functionalities to be turned on or off (e.g., baskets, saved queries, etc.).Customizing the application's UI with Vanilla Builder. Note that modifying the application in Vanilla Builder does not directly modify its source code. It modifies a JSON configuration describing the layout and configuration of each component. This configuration is persisted in the administrator's User Settings, but it can also be downloaded and reopened later for further customization. Implement changes in the application code. Making changes in the application's source code is more consequential than changes in the configuration because there are multiple factors to consider: The versioning of the code (see version control guide)The process of deployment (see deployment guide)And most importantly: any change that you apply may eventually conflict with a future update and/or might necessitate future maintenance (see the next point). Update the SBA Framework. Sinequa regularly releases new versions of the libraries and applications. These updates often introduce breaking changes: Library upgrades (Angular, Bootstrap, RxJS, D3, etc.) often introduce breaking changes. So when Sinequa upgrades these libraries, the entire codebase is migrated accordingly.As the SBA Framework evolves, bugs are fixed, features are added, and components &amp; applications are refactored. These changes can be in direct conflict with how you use these components or how you customized these components. warning If your application is heavily customized, these updates will probably be difficult. If your customization makes use of, say, Bootstrap, you will have to follow the relevant guide from Bootstrap to migrate your code. Carefully read the updates guide to learn how to manage this situation and how to be prepared by adopting development and version control best practices. note To recap: You must take ownership of anything you customize. This includes taking responsibility for fixing conflicts with future updates and potentially migrating your code when libraries are upgraded.

The components of Vanilla Search described above use three configuration objects:  FEATURES: a list of string that controls which features are activated in the app. This list is used to determine which facets are displayed in the homepage, which menus are displayed in the search page, which objects are searched by the autocomplete, and which options are available in the search form, such as the advanced search form or the voice recognition button. FACETS: a list of FacetConfig objects that determines the facets displayed within the sq-facet-multi component. Each object contains a number of options that are passed to the corresponding facet components. For example: { name: &quot;geo&quot;, aggregation: &quot;Geo&quot;, title: &quot;msg#facet.geo.title&quot;, type: &quot;list&quot;, icon: &quot;fas fa-fw fa-globe-americas&quot;, parameters: { showCount: true, searchable: true, focusSearch: true, allowExclude: true, allowOr: true, allowAnd: false, displayEmptyDistributionIntervals: false, } } Of course, these facets require a corresponding Aggregation to exist on the Sinequa server, and consequently within the Results object. METADATA_CONFIG: a list of MetadataConfig to be displayed in the &quot;mini-preview&quot;, within a sq-metadata component (More information in the Custom Metadata section). PREVIEW_HIGHLIGHTS: a list of PreviewHighlightColors used in the preview related components to define the highlights colors for the different entities (More information in the Custom Entities section).

Many SBA components have an @Input() results parameter to display data from the search results.Output bindings: A child component can emit events to its parent component (via the syntax &lt;my-component (outputEvent)=&quot;handler($event)&quot;&gt;). When the child component emits an event, the parent component's handler is called.Events: Services can emit events that are listened to by components. For example, the Angular router emits events when the URL changes. Similarly, the SearchService emits events when the search results are updated.Observables: RxJS observables are used to represent asynchronous data streams.

The state can be persisted in the following places:  The browser URL: A URL /hello?query=world encodes a navigation state (i.e., the page is &quot;hello&quot; and the query is &quot;world&quot;). The URL is &quot;de facto&quot; persisted as it remains the same when the user refreshes the page. In an SBA, the search query is generally encoded in the URL.

The General tab of the Query web service configuration allows the configuration of these key parameters:  Index list: The list of indexes which this web service may query.QueryPlugin: A server-side plugin (written in C#), which lets you customize the search queries, or post-process the responses.Aggregations: A list of Aggregations. An aggregation is a short-list of metadata computed for the given query.

Tabs filter on a single column of the index (e.g. the format of document, name of the data source, etc.). The Angular application may select a tab by setting query.tab = '&lt;tab name&gt;'.Search scopes: A &quot;scope&quot; can restrict the search to a specific subset of the corpus, with SQL rules. The Angular application may select a scope by setting query.scope = '&lt;scope name&gt;'. Unlike tabs, it is not possible to compute the number of documents for each scope with one query (since each scope has a specific ruleset).Relevant Extracts: The relevant extracts are key passages and sentences found in the searched documents, which are then used to compute a short summary typically displayed in the search results.

This means that the grid downloads only the bits of data that it needs to display. Concretely, when users scroll down the list of results, the component fetches more data from Sinequa (using pagination parameters) and displays them on the fly.  This configuration involves various steps:  The ag-grid-angular component is configured with the following settings: &lt;ag-grid-angular ... [rowModelType]=&quot;'infinite'&quot; [cacheBlockSize]=&quot;appService.ccquery?.pageSize || 20&quot; [blockLoadDebounceMillis]=&quot;300&quot;&gt; This means that the data is downloaded from the server in blocks of 20 records (unless a different value is configured) and that to avoid flooding the server when scrolling fast, we wait for 300ms before downloading each block. Row data is not passed directly to the grid. Instead, a Datasource object is created: // Create a new datasource this.datasource = this.makeDatasource(); // Apply to the grid this.gridApi.setDatasource(this.datasource); This datasource is responsible for providing data asynchronously, taking into account the current state of the query as well as the pagination parameters, custom filters and sorting parameters that the ag-grid component provides. Our implementation of the IDatasource interface is available in the SqDatasource class. At the moment, most of the complexity comes from the management of the wide range of filter types supported by AG Grid (contains, equals, startsWith, etc.), which is translated into fielded search syntax (including regular expression for some of these filters).

Additionally, the provider can generate nodes and edges for the properties contained in that record. For example, if a record has &quot;person&quot; entities as a property, each of these &quot;person&quot; entity can be displayed as a property linked to the record:  // Create a standard &quot;document&quot; node type const doc = providerFactory.createRecordNodeType(); // Create a standard &quot;person&quot; node type const person = providerFactory.createPersonNodeType(); // Create an edge type for the &quot;person&quot; property of the &quot;document&quot; node const struct = providerFactory.createStructuralEdgeTypes(doc, [person], &quot;oninsert&quot;, &quot;all&quot;); // Create a provider that provides document nodes with their structural neighbors, given a list of record objects const provider = providerFactory.createRecordsProvider(doc, struct, records);     The sample code above demonstrate the usage of the factory's createStructuralEdgeTypes() method.

Instead we used the generic createNodeType() method, and used the factory to generate dynamic node options. The options are &quot;dynamic&quot;, because each node will look different from the others (indeed, we want each node to show the picture of a person). The createDynamicImageNodeOptions() requires a function taking the node as an input, and returning the URL of the image (in this case stored in the record's sourcevarchar4 column). See Node and Edge types.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Aggregation Provider​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Network Module","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/analytics/network#aggregation-provider","content":" The AggregationProvider class provides nodes and edges generated from an aggregation. Aggregations are computed by the Sinequa engine based on the content of one column (or more) of an index. Aggregation are typically used to compute the content of facets (See Facet Module).  The aggregation provider can be used to generate different types of relations between metadata:  Statistical relations: In this case, we use cross-aggregations to count the number of records which contain two values of metadata. For example, we can count how many documents both have docformat=pdf and author=John Doe. The most frequent pairs of metadata are translated into edges between these metadata.Proximity relations: In this case, we use aggregations to count the number of cooccurence entities stored within a specific column. A cooccurrence entity stores the occurrence of two other entities within a short range of text, like in the sentence &quot;Larry Page works at Google&quot;, which could be normalized as (LARRY PAGE)#(GOOGLE). The cooccurrences are then translated as edges between each entity.Semantic relations: In this case, we use aggregations to count the number of semantic entities stored within a specific column. A semantic entity stores the typed relation between two entities, like in the sentence &quot;Larry Page is an engineer who works at the company Google&quot; (unlike in the previous example, &quot;work at&quot; can be normalized as a type of relation between the two entities, so that this sentence could be stored as (GOOGLE)#(EMPLOYS)#(LARRY PAGE)). Then this relation between the two entities can be visualized as a directed typed edge.  Assuming the entities are properly extracted from documents, normalized and stored in columns of the index, the following example describe how to use the AggregationProvider to produce different types of network visualizations.  Note that in all cases, aggregations are computed in the context of the current query of the SearchService, unless a different Query is passed to the provider as an optional input. This means if you search for &quot;Google&quot;, the top relations built by this provider should normally include companies like Google, and people like Larry Page.  Statistical relations​  First we need to configure the cross-aggregation calculation on the server in the Query web service (see Server configuration).  Configuration for a cross-aggregation between the company and person columns  // Create two standard node types for persons and companies const person = providerFactory.createPersonNodeType(); const company = providerFactory.createCompanyNodeType(); // Create an edge type between these two node types const edge = providerFactory.createAggregationEdgeType([company, person], &quot;Company_Person&quot;) // Create the provider, given the edge type const provider = providerFactory.createAggregationProvider([edge]);     Note that the size of each node is proportional to the width of adjacent edges, which itself reflects the &quot;count&quot; of each pair in the distribution (which is equal to the number of documents containing both metadata).  Proximity relations​  First we need to configure the aggregation calculation on the server in the Query web service (see Server configuration).  The aggregation must be computed for a column where co-occurrences are stored in the format (VALUE 1)#(VALUE 2).  The code below is almost identical to the one above for statistical relations. The difference is that we are calling the createCoocAggregationEdgeType() method instead of createAggregationEdgeType().  // Create two standard node types for persons and companies const person = providerFactory.createPersonNodeType(); const company = providerFactory.createCompanyNodeType(); // Create an cooccurrence aggregation edge type between these two node types const edge = providerFactory.createCoocAggregationEdgeType([company, person], &quot;Company_Person_Cooc&quot;) // Create the provider, given the edge type const provider = providerFactory.createAggregationProvider([edge]);     Semantic relations​  First we need to configure the aggregation calculation on the server in the Query web service (see Server configuration).  The aggregation must be computed for a column where co-occurrences are stored in the format (VALUE 1)#(TYPE)#(VALUE 2).  The code below is almost identical to the one above for statistical relations. The difference is that we are calling the createTypedCoocAggregationEdgeType() method instead of createAggregationEdgeType().  // Create two standard node types for persons and companies const person = providerFactory.createPersonNodeType(); const company = providerFactory.createCompanyNodeType(); // Create a typed cooccurrence aggregation edge type between these two node types const edge = providerFactory.createTypedCoocAggregationEdgeType([person, company], &quot;Person_Job_Company_Cooc&quot;) // Create the provider, given the edge type const provider = providerFactory.createAggregationProvider([edge]);     Expanding nodes​  In the example aboves, the aggregation edges are created with trigger=&quot;source&quot;, which means the data is fetched right away and inserted in the network.  But, it is also possible to use aggregations to attach new nodes to existing nodes (&quot;expanding&quot; them). In this case, instead of using cross-distributions or cooccurrence, a regular 1-dimension aggregation must be provided.  The provider will query the server for this distribution, and adding a WHERE clause to &quot;fix&quot; the source node. For example, if we want to expand the node Paris of type geo, with say, companies, the distribution queried to the server will be computed with:  SELECT DISTRIBUTION('company') as companies FROM ... WHERE ... AND geo = 'Paris' ...   Note that the SKIP and COUNT parameter of the distribution are automatically adjusted by the provider, so that expanding the node multiple times will yield more data (until exhaustion).  This computation is equivalent to a cross distribution of geo and company (where one half is fixed). Therefore combining &quot;source&quot; cross-distribution edges with &quot;onclick&quot; or &quot;manual&quot; will be consistent.  // Create two standard node types for persons and companies const person = providerFactory.createPersonNodeType(); const company = providerFactory.createCompanyNodeType(); // Create an edge type between these two node types const edge = providerFactory.createAggregationEdgeType([company, person], &quot;Company_Person&quot;) // Create an edge type to expand &quot;company&quot; with the &quot;person&quot; distribution. &quot;manual&quot; means a button is displayed when clicking on a company node to create the expansion. const expandCompany = providerFactory.createAggregationEdgeType([company, person], &quot;person&quot;, undefined, &quot;manual&quot;); // Create the provider, given the edge type const provider = providerFactory.createAggregationProvider([edge, expandCompany]);     ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Dynamic providers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Network Module","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/analytics/network#dynamic-providers","content":" Dynamic providers are extensions of RecordsProvider. The list of records is fetched dynamically from the server, given a query. There are two types of dynamic providers:  Dynamic edge provider: Provides record nodes (and optionally their structural edges) that will be attached to existing nodes via &quot;dynamic edges&quot;.Dynamic node provider: Transforms an existing node into a record node (and its structural edges)  ⚠️ Dynamic providers can potentially generate multiple parallel queries to the engine, depending on the settings you choose. Be careful not overflowing the engine and optimizing your queries as much as possible.  Dynamic edge provider​  A dynamic edge provider (DynamicEdgeProvider) attaches record nodes to an existing node. For example, we can create a first record provider that generates nodes for documents, and when these nodes are inserted, we query the engine for people nodes related to these documents.  // Create a standard document node type const doc = providerFactory.createRecordNodeType(); // Create a standard provider for records const recordProvider = providerFactory.createRecordsProvider(doc, [], records); // Create a node type of people, displaying the image of that person instead of a generic icon const people = providerFactory.createNodeType(&quot;person&quot;, providerFactory.createDynamicImageNodeOptions( (node: Node) =&gt; (node as RecordNode).record['sourcevarchar4'] || &quot;&quot; ) ); // Create a dynamic edge type, that creates a query to fetch people related to that document const dynamicEdgeType = providerFactory.createDynamicEdgeType([doc, people], &quot;oninsert&quot;, (node: Node, type: DynamicEdgeType) =&gt; { const query = searchService.makeQuery(); query.text = node.label; query.addSelect(&quot;treepath:=/Web/Wiki/&quot;); query.addSelect(&quot;category:=human&quot;); // Special column from the wikipedia index query.pageSize = 5; return query; }); // Create a dynamic edge provider to create the dynamic edges whose type we just defined const peopleProvider = providerFactory.createDynamicEdgeProvider(dynamicEdgeType, [], true, &quot;People&quot;, [recordProvider]);     Note that the dynamic edge provider creates record nodes which can themselves have structural edges:  const company = providerFactory.createCompanyNodeType(); const struct = providerFactory.createStructuralEdgeTypes(people, [company]); const peopleProvider = providerFactory.createDynamicEdgeProvider(dynamicEdgeType, struct, true, [recordProvider]);     Dynamic node provider​  A dynamic node provider (DynamicNodeProvider) transforms (&quot;mutates&quot;) an existing node into a record node. For example, a metadata node for the person &quot;Bill Gates&quot; can be enriched with the wikipedia article about Bill Gates.  In the following example, we start by creating an aggregation provider, displaying people and company relations. But the second provider enriches people nodes (when clicked on) with their wikipedia page (which allows to transform the appearance of the node and display their wikipedia pictures instead of an icon).  // Create the node types for the company and person entities const company = providerFactory.createCompanyNodeType(); const person = providerFactory.makeNodeTypeDynamic( // By default, the node is a standard person node providerFactory.createPersonNodeType(), // This function returns the query necessary to transform the node (node: Node) =&gt; { let query = searchService.makeQuery(); query.text = node.label; query.addSelect(&quot;treepath:=/Web/Wiki/&quot;); query.addSelect(&quot;category:=human&quot;); // Special column from the wikipedia index query.pageSize = 1; return query }, // The node options to use after the node has been transformed (displaying an image instead of an icon) providerFactory.createDynamicImageNodeOptions( (node: Node) =&gt; (node as RecordNode).record['sourcevarchar4'] || &quot;&quot; ) ); // Create structural edges from the document nodes to the person and company entities const structEdges = providerFactory.createStructuralEdgeTypes(person, [company, person], &quot;oninsert&quot;, &quot;paginate&quot;); // Create aggregation edges to link companies and people const company_person = providerFactory.createAggregationEdgeType([company, person], &quot;Company_Person&quot;); // Create the aggregation provider const aggProvider = providerFactory.createAggregationProvider([company_person]); // Create the dynamic node provider const personProvider = providerFactory.createDynamicNodeProvider(person, structEdges, false, &quot;People&quot;, [aggProvider]);     ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Interactions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Network Module","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/analytics/network#interactions","content":" When clicking on a node or edge, it is possible to display info cards, which display information, and actions, which display buttons or menus associated with the given node or edge.

In this section, we will go through the main keys of how to easily instantiate an advanced search form :  First of all, we need to build the form. The best practice is to create a new component containing all the business logic.    The main idea is to start by adding your controls to the form object. Here, you can easily apply validators as much as you want :   this.form.addControl('treepath', this.advancedService.createSelectControl('treepath')); this.form.addControl('modified', this.advancedService.createRangeControl('modified', [ this.advancedService.validators.range('modified'), this.advancedService.validators.date('modified') ] )); this.form.addControl('person', this.advancedService.createMultiInputControl('person')); this.form.addControl('docformat', this.advancedService.createInputControl('docformat'));   In this example, we add several FormControl such as modified, to which we apply 2 validators; range() and date(). You can also note that the build process of the form is set in the callback of this.firstPageService.getFirstPage(). Its role is to load autocompletion suggestions and whatever data needed in the initialization of advanced-search components. You should carefully notice that the name of each formControl is exactly the same as its field property.  Next step is to mutually update of the form and the query according to users interactions. This is the role of both methods updateFormOnQueryChange() and updateQuery(). Then, feel free to design the look &amp; feel of your advanced search form as you want. Once the component is ready, you can integrate it in the search form :  &lt;sq-search-form #searchForm [query]=&quot;searchService.query&quot; [showFilterCount]=&quot;true&quot; [autoSubmit]=&quot;false&quot;&gt; &lt;ng-template let-query&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;search-dropdown border-top m-2&quot;&gt; ... &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;small fw-bold mb-1 ms-3 me-auto&quot;&gt;Advanced Search Form:&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- The new advanced search form you have just created ! --&gt; &lt;sq-advanced-form [query]=&quot;query&quot; (filterEdit)=&quot;onFiltersChange()&quot;&gt; &lt;/sq-advanced-form&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/ng-template&gt; &lt;/sq-search-form&gt;  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Timeline Module","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/analytics/timeline","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Features​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Timeline Module","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/analytics/timeline#features","content":" This module includes a Timeline visualization for temporal data based on the D3 library.

Additionally, the following parameters from TimelineSeries are optional and work in the same way (see above): name, areaStyles, lineStyles and showDatapoints.  TimelineCombinedAggregations requires the following parameters:  aggregations: An array of TimelineAggregation. These aggregations configured on the server should typically be computed on the same sourcedatetime column but with different masks. The masks allow to modulate the resolution of the aggregation. Using a fine-grained mask (YYYY-MM-DD) potentially returns a lot of data unless we query the aggregation with a selection (&quot;date between X and Y&quot;), which is exactly what our component is doing to always offer optimum accuracy and performance.maxNMonths: An array of number, each corresponding to the maximum number of months for a given aggregation (the array must be the same size as aggregations). These are the &quot;breakpoints&quot; at which the component will switch to an aggregation better suited to the current scale of the timeline. For example, if the X axis is 13.4 months long, the component will choose the aggregation with the minimum maxNMonths such that maxNMonths &gt; 13.4. If the array is [-1, 48, 12, 2], then 48 is selected (-1 is infinity).default: The TimelineAggregation to initialize the view (it should typically be a coarse-grained aggregation, returning few values even for a large scale).

This allows the user to quickly visualize how the top, most relevant data is distributed in time, and filter this data accordingly. Furthermore, the component listens for selection changes from the SelectionService and can modify the event styling for selected records (which makes it easy for a user to see where a selected record is placed on the timeline).An aggregation of events: If a column of the index stores &quot;events&quot;, they can be aggregated by the engine and displayed on the timeline. An &quot;event&quot; in that sense is a normalized field that contains a date and name/id. For example (2020-02-14)#(VALENTINES DAY), which is the format of extraction of cooccurrences (but any format can be used). Note that Sinequa ES includes a very capable Text-Mining Agent that can extract date entities from text in a wide array of formats and languages.

The TimelineRecords requires the field parameter, which specifies which column to use to place the record on the timeline. The display parameter is optional (by default, record.title is displayed). The styles parameter is also optional, and it allows to generate the TimelineEvent's styles property. Similarly, an optional size parameter allows to customize the size. Note that styles and size can each be a static value (size: 10) or a dynamic value, computed individually for each record (size: (record, selected) =&gt; selected? 10 : 5).  The TimelineEventAggregation requires the name of the aggregation configured on the server (aggregation), as well as two methods, getDate and getDisplay, which respectively extract a Date and display (string) from each AggregationItem object. In the example above, the events from this aggregation are supposed to be formatted as (2020-02-14)#(VALENTINES DAY) (hence the use of .split() and .replace()).

Note that sq-facet-timeline listens to the events triggered by sq-timeline:  When the user zooms in and out, a rangeChange event is triggered. The facet captures this event and updates the data of any TimelineCombinedAggregation in function of the new scale. When the user selects a range of dates by clicking and dragging the mouse over the chart, a selectionChange event is triggered. The facet captures this event and filters the search accordingly, using the SearchService. The filter is applied to the metadata plotted by each TimelineAggregation. For example, if we plot 2 time series corresponding to 2 aggregations computed on the modified and sourcedatetime3, the filter will be modified BETWEEN x AND Y OR sourcedatetime3 BETWEEN x AND y. When the user clicks on a event, the tooltip showing the event's display parameter actually displays a clickable link.

A selected item contains at least the id property of the associated Record object.

The storage property may also be a function that maps a record to a custom object (which must contain at least the record's id). ⚠️ The list returned by this method is a copy of the list maintained by this service. Therefore modifying this list will have no effect on the selection. To add, remove or reorder items, one must use the appropriate methods listed below. getSelectedIds(): returns the list of ids (as string) of the selected items. This method always work in the same way regardless of the SelectionOptions (it should therefore be preferred when possible, to implement new functionality based on this service). haveSelectedRecords: is true if there are selected records. getSelectedCount(): returns the number of selected items. allRecordsSelected: is true if all records in the search service results are selected. toggleSelectedRecords(record?: Record, source?: string): This method allows to add or remove records to/from the selection. It takes two optional arguments: record: a specific record to add or remove to/from the selection. If this parameter is omitted or undefined, all the records in the search service's results or added or removed (they are all removed only if they were all selected). source: an identifier for the type of source which causes the selection change. The source will be included in the events emitted by the service, and it can be used by client services if they listen to these events. This method generates a SELECT or UNSELECT event. moveSelectedRecord(record: Record, newIndex: number): Moves a selected record to a different index. The input record must be already in the selection. This method generates a MOVE event. clearSelectedRecords(): Unselect all selected records. This method generates an UNSELECT event.  Additionally, the service includes the following properties:  events: a Subject emitting events of three types: SELECT, UNSELECT and MOVE, when the selection changes. These events (SelectionEvent) include the list of records concerned by the event, as well as the (optional) source of the event. selectionActions: a list of Action (See Action module) that can be registered by other services. These actions are automatically updated when the selection changes.

If the action includes an update method, it can, for example, hide itself if there is no selected document. These actions can be registered within a service or a component, typically at the start of the application.

At a minimum the data will define the locale for the Intl library and the messages in the locale's language. Locale data for additional 3rd party libaries (eg D3.js, Moment.js) can also be included. The supported locales for an application are defined by passing a class derived fromLocalesConfig to the IntlModule.forRoot static method when importing the IntlNodule in your application's NgModule:  import { LocalesConfig, Locale } from &quot;@sinequa/core/intl&quot;; import enLocale from &quot;../locales/en&quot;; ... export class AppLocalesConfig implements LocalesConfig { defaultLocale: Locale; locales?: Locale[]; constructor() { this.locales = [ { name: &quot;en&quot;, display: &quot;msg#locale.en&quot;, data: enLocale}, { name: &quot;fr&quot;, display: &quot;msg#locale.fr&quot;, data: frLocale}, { name: &quot;de&quot;, display: &quot;msg#locale.de&quot;, data: deLocale}, ] this.defaultLocale = this.locales[0]; } } ... @NgModule({ imports: [ ...

By default, the passed value will be persistent (stored in local storage).  this.intlService.use('fr');   Each time the locale is changed an event is raised which can be subscribed to like this:  this.intlService.events.subscribe( (event) =&gt; { console.log('new locale selected:', event.locale); } );   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Messages​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Intl Module","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/core/intl#messages","content":" Messages defined in locale message files can be accessed by IntlService.formatMessage. The keys must be prefixed by msg# and the remainder of the key is then a simple JSON path lookup into the messages object for the current locale. So, for a messages object with the following structure:  { &quot;sectionOne&quot;: { &quot;greeting1&quot;: &quot;This is greeting one&quot;, &quot;greeting2&quot;: &quot;This is greeting two&quot; }, &quot;sectionTwo&quot;: { &quot;greeting1&quot;: &quot;This is greeting one in sectionTwo&quot; } }   A call to this.intlService.formatMessage('msg#sectionOne.greeting2') would return This is greeting two.  Messages use ICU Message syntax that supports displaying variable values (strings, numbers and dates) and handles pluralization rules according to the current locale. A map of values can be passed as the second parameter to IntlService.formatMessage. For example, if message2 above were changed to Hello {name} and then formatted by calling this.intlService.formatMessage('msg#sectionOne.greeting2', {name: 'Tom'}); the result would be Hello Tom.  For more information on the ICU Message syntax please follow this link.  The sqMessage pipe is provided to facilitate the formatting of messages in component templates. Internally, it callsIntlService.formatMessage but also handles changes to the current locale, allowing any text displayed through the pipe to be refreshed automatically. The above example could be rendered in a template as follows:  &lt;span&gt;{% raw %}{{'#msgsectionOne.greeting2' | sqMessage:{values: {name: 'Tom'} } }}{% endraw %}&lt;/span&gt;   Note the use of spaces between the closing curly brackets in the parameter passed to the pipe. Without these spaces they would be interpreted as the termination of the interpolated value by the Angular template parser and an error would occur.

A server-side custom parser takes the form of a function plugin namedParseExpressionValue which takes the custom parser name and the value to be parsed as parameters:  public class ParseExpressionValue : FunctionPlugin { public override string GetValue(IDocContext ctxt, params string[] values) { if (values.Length &lt;= 1) return null; var parser = values[0]; var value = values[1]; if (parser == &quot;mycustomparser&quot;) { // return the parsed value here } return null; } }  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Utils Module","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/components/utils","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Features​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Utils Module","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/components/utils#features","content":" This module provides the following Angular declarations that are useful for the definition of your documents:  Angular pipes that can be used to format the display of value on your components,Directives that can be used to control the user interaction with your components,The injection token SCREEN_SIZE_RULES to override the component sizing rules based on window/screen size of the application.The UIService  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Import​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Utils Module","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/components/utils#import","content":" import { UtilsModule, SCREEN_SIZE_RULES } from '@sinequa/components/utils'; /* If you want to change the screen size rules provided by @sinequa/components */ export const myScreenSizeRules = { xl: &quot;(min-width: 1650px)&quot;, lg: &quot;(min-width: 1400px) and (max-width: 1649.98px)&quot;, md: &quot;(min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1399.98px)&quot;, sm: &quot;(min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 991.98px)&quot;, xs: &quot;(max-width: 575.98px)&quot;, }; @NgModule({ imports: [ /*....*/ UtilsModule, /*....*/ ], providers: [ /* If you want to change the screen size rules provided by @sinequa/components */ { provide: SCREEN_SIZE_RULES, useValue: myScreenSizeRules }, /*....*/ ], /*....*/ })   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"API usage​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Utils Module","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/components/utils#api-usage","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Pipes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Utils Module","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/components/utils#pipes","content":" This modules provides the following Angular pipes  DatePipe​  DatePipe provides the sqDate pipe that formats a Date object or a number of ticks (in number) to a localized date string.  Example:  &lt;span&gt;Date:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;{{ new Date('2020-03-25') | sqDate }}&lt;/span&gt;   yields (for English locale)  &lt;span&gt;Date:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;03/25/2020&lt;/span&gt;   This is equivalent as importing IntlService and calling IntlService.formatDate().  MomentPipe​  If you use the moment.js library to manipulate date and time value instead of Date from javascript, you can use MomentPipe to format your moment values.  The pipe accepts a MomentParams to configure the formatting result:  format: The format of the result date, if this property is given, the pipe ignores the other properties,type: The type of value formatting, the valid values are: 'iso': formats the moment object as ISO-8601 date string, eg. 'Tue Mar 24 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100' =&gt; '2020-03-23T23:00:00.000Z','unix': formats the moment object as Unix timestamp (i.e. the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch - January 1 1970 12AM UTC), eg. 'Tue Mar 24 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100' =&gt; '1585004400','valueOf' same as 'unix' but the unit is in milliseconds, eg. 'Tue Mar 24 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100' =&gt; '1585004400000','daysInMonth': formats the moment object as the number of days in the given month, of the given year, eg. 'Tue Feb 24 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100' =&gt; '29' or 'Tue Feb 24 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0100' =&gt; '28''fromNow': formats the moment object as user-friendly relative time to the current time, which is also called timeago, eg. 'Tue Jan 24 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100' =&gt; '2 months ago' (current time being Tue Mar 24 2020). see moment.fromNow().'from': same as 'fromNow' but you can specify the reference date (as moment object) using reference property. see moment.from().'toNow': same as 'toNow' but in the opposite interval, one can think 'toNow' === -'fromNow', eg. 'Tue Jan 24 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100' =&gt; 'in 2 months' (current time being Tue Mar 24 2020). see moment.toNow().'to': same as 'toNow' but you can specify specify the reference date (as moment object) using reference property. see moment.to().'calendar': displays time relative to a reference time (given by the reference object, or default to current time). It is slightly different to 'fromX' or 'toX' in that the result string depends on how close to the reference time your value is, eg. 'Tue Mar 22 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100' =&gt; 'Last Sunday at 12:00 AM' (current time being Tue Mar 24 2020) or 'Mon Mar 30 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100' =&gt; 'Monday at 1:00 AM' (current time being Tue Mar 24 2020). see moment.calendar().'diff': displays the time difference w.r.t. a reference time (given by the reference object) in milliseconds, it has the same direction as 'fromX', eg. 'Tue Mar 22 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100' with reference 'Mon Mar 30 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100' =&gt; '-518400000'. see moment.diff(). suffix: if false, a chronological suffix (i.e. 'ago' or 'in ...' ) is added to the result of 'fromX' and 'toX'. If true, a neutral time amount is returned, eg. 'a months', 'two years'.reference: The reference date for the formatting of 'from', 'to', 'calendar' and 'diff'unit: The time unit when formatting with 'diff', eg. 'hours', 'seconds'.precise: The 'diff' formatting returns a rounded integer by default, if you want a floating-point number instead, put this property as true.  &lt;span&gt;Moment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;{{ moment('1995-12-25') | sqMoment:{ type: 'fromNow', reference: moment('2015-12-25') } }}&lt;/span&gt;   yields  &lt;span&gt;Moment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;24 years&lt;/span&gt;   RelativeTimePipe​  RelativeTimePipe provides the sqRelativeTime pipe that formats a number, specifying a date time relative to the current time, to a localized date time string.  This pipe is inspired from ECMA-402 RelativeTimeFormat Objects.  Example:  &lt;span&gt;Relative time:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;{{ -7 | sqRelativeTime:{unit: 'days'} }}&lt;/span&gt;   yields (in English locale)  &lt;span&gt;Relative time:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;7 days ago&lt;/span&gt;   This is equivalent as importing IntlService and calling IntlService.formatRelativeTime().  TimePipe​  TimePipe provides the sqTime pipe that formats a Date object or a number of ticks (in number) to a localized time string.  Example:  &lt;span&gt;Time:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;{{ new Date('2020-03-25 12:20:00.00Z') | sqTime }}&lt;/span&gt;   yields (for English locale and UTC)  &lt;span&gt;Time:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;12:20:00&lt;/span&gt;   This is equivalent as importing IntlService and calling IntlService.formatTime().  MemorySizePipe​  MemorySizePipe provides the sqMemorySize pipe that formats a file size in bytes a localized size string with the appropriate size unit (TB, GB, etc.).  Example:  &lt;span&gt;Size:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;{{ 16384 | sqMemorySize }}&lt;/span&gt;   yields (for English locale)  &lt;span&gt;Size:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;16KB&lt;/span&gt;   This is equivalent as importing FormatService and calling FormatService.formatMemorySize().  NumberPipe​  NumberPipe provides the sqNumber pipe that formats a number to the locale format, i.e. using dot '.' as floating point for English and comma ',' for French.  Example:  &lt;span&gt;Decimal number:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;{{ 3.14 | sqNumber }}&lt;/span&gt;   yields (for French locale)  &lt;span&gt;Size:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;3,14&lt;/span&gt;   This is equivalent as importing IntlService and calling Intl.formatNumber().  ValuePipe​  ValuePipe provides the sqValue pipe that formats a value coming from an index column based on the value type of that column.  Example:  &lt;div&gt;boolean:&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;{{ true | sqValue }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;number:&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;{{ 3.14 | sqValue }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   yields (in French locale)  &lt;div&gt;boolean:&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;vrai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;number:&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;3,14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   This is equivalent as importing FormatService and calling Intl.formatFieldValue().  ExprPipe​  ExprPipe provides the sqExpr pipe that is mainly used to display a query filter. You can see the usage of this pipe in the breadcrumbs or MySearch facet.  Filters displayed with ExprPipe in breadcrumbs  Example:  &lt;span title=&quot;{{item.display | sqExpr:{withFields: displayFieldNames} }}&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Directives​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Utils Module","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/components/utils#directives","content":" Autofocus directive​  The sqAutofocus directive specifies which input component to be automatically focused when your component is opened.  Example:  &lt;textarea type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;myInput&quot; sqAutofocus &gt;   ClickOutside directive​  The sqClickOutside directive is a syntactic sugar that helps you manage the behavior of your input component when user clicks outside the component area.  The input for this directive is a ClickOutsideOptions:  exclude: A list of HTML selectors for the HTML elements that will not be effected by this directive. If any HTML element not matching the HTML selectors but contains matching children HTML is also ignored by the directive.  When a user clicks outside of your component, the directive emits an click event via its output sqClickOutside. By providing a callback to this output, you can act on the event.  Example:  &lt;form name=&quot;myform&quot; novalidate [formGroup]=&quot;form&quot;&gt; &lt;sq-modal [title]=&quot;model.title&quot; [buttons]=&quot;buttons&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;form-group sq-form-group&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;myInput&quot;&gt;Input:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;sq-label-input&quot; (sqClickOutside)=&quot;clickOutside()&quot; name=&quot;myInput&quot; [(ngModel)]=&quot;myInputRef.value&quot; &gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/sq-modal&gt; &lt;/form&gt;   ScrollIntoView directive​  The sqScrollIntoView directive is a syntactic sugar that helps to make sure a dynamically rendered child component of the current component to be in the visible area of the window.  This is useful when your component contains some kind of dropdown menu or collapsible part that you want to make sure to be visible when user opens or expands that part.  You can pass a ScrollIntoViewOptions as input of the directive:  active: whether the child component should be in the visible area,first: whether the child component is the first element in the list of elements to be considered.  Example:  &lt;span [sqScrollIntoView]=&quot;{active: true}&quot;&gt;Some item that is needed to be scrolled into visible area&lt;/span&gt;   FocusKeyList and FocusKeyListItem directives​  The sqFocusKeyList directive and sqFocusKeyListItem directive are used together to provide keyboard navigation functionality to items in lists, such as a results list. The sqFocusKeyList directive is added to the container element and the sqFocusKeyListItem directive is added to each child element. The sqFocusKeyList directive has the following inputs:  activeItem: the index of the currently active itemwithWrap: a boolean value indicating whether navigation should wrap on the first and last items. The default is true.  Additionally, sqFocusKeyList raises the itemSelect event with the index of the newly selected item.  Example:  &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot; sqFocusKeyList [activeItem]=&quot;currentIndex&quot; (itemSelect)=&quot;currentIndex = $event&quot;&gt; &lt;div *ngFor=&quot;let item of items&quot; class=&quot;item&quot; sqFocusKeyListItem&gt;{{item.name}}&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   ResizeEvent directive​  The sqResize directive uses the native ResizeObserver browser API to generate an event any time the associated element changes size. The new contentRect of the element is passed with the event. A polyfill is used to emulate this functionality for Internet Explorer.  Example:  &lt;div (sqResize)=&quot;onResize($event)&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   Sticky Component​  The sqSticky component is a container that &quot;sticks&quot; to the top and the bottom of the screen when scrolling. For example, a sidebar containing facets will be always visible on the screen, even when scrolling down a long list of results. Additionally, if the sidebar is itself very long, it will scroll with the content until reaching the bottom of the side bar (and then &quot;stick&quot; to the bottom of the screen). Note that this behavior is not possible when using a simple position: sticky or Bootstrap's sticky-top.  The component accepts as input an object containing the offsets with respect to the top and bottom of the screen. The default value is {top: 0, bottom: 0}.    Note that in Internet Explorer position: sticky is not supported, so the component automatically deactivates its sticky behavior.

There are two event streams that you can subscribe to receive the screen sizing events:  priorityResizeEvent: Observable&lt;UIEvent&gt; This listeners of this stream will be be notified of the resize events first. This may be useful when you want to hierarchize the behavior of your components w.r.t to a resizing event.resizeEvent: Observable&lt;UIEvent&gt;  You can also listen to the resizing of a specific HTML element by adding your listeners with UIService.addElementResizeListener(htmlElement, callback) without bothering about the priority of your listener.  In order to remove a listener added by UIService.addElementResizeListener(), use UIService.removeElementResizeListener(htmlElement, callback).

In the case of a manual login via the modal dialog the original request will be resubmitted with the entered credentials. For OAuth and SAML the browser will redirect to the authentication provider and back again to the app. If Windows Authentication (Kerberos/NTLM) is being used then authentication will be handled at a lower level - the HTTP 401 errors shouldn't reach the application.

Ensure that the user is logged in at component instantiation like this:  ngAfterViewInit() { this.loginService.login(); }   The login method of the LoginService makes calls to AppService.init, PrincipalWebService.load and UserSettingsWebService.load. A login is successful if all three of these calls are successful. The LoginService maintains a boolean complete property that indicates the current login status. It also emits session events when the login status changes: session-start (login), session-end (logout) andsession-changed (complete state changes).  A helper class, ComponentWithLogin, is provided which formalizes a way to interact with the LoginService.

Emit user notification​  There are four types of notifications, which are defined by the enum value NotificationType. The valid values are Success, Info, Warning and Error.  The NotificationsService provides methods to rapidly emit a notification of each of these types:  NotificationsService.success() emits a Success notification.  The method signature is  success( text: string, params?: MapOf&lt;any&gt;, title?: string ): Notification   Example 1: success notification  this.notificationsService.success('A success message');   which yields  A success notification  NotificationsService.info() emits an Info notification.  The method signature is  info( text: string, // The message, could be internationalized (i18n) message. params?: MapOf&lt;any&gt;,// The formatting parameters for the message. title?: string // The title (header) of the notification. ): Notification   Example 2: info notification  this.notificationsService.info('An info message');   which yields  An info notification  NotificationsService.warning() emits an Warning notification.

This is not fixed and you can can choose to make short-lived error notifications or info notification that stays on the screen until user closes it. This can be done using the method NotificationsService.success().  The method signature is  notify( type: NotificationType, // The notification type text: string, // The message, could be internationalized (i18n) message. params?: MapOf&lt;any&gt;, // The formatting parameters for the message. title?: string, // The title (header) of the notification. autoClose?: boolean // Whether the notification automatically closes after a certain time ): Notification   Example 5: custom notification  this.notificationsService.notify(NotificationType.Info, 'An info message');   which yields  A custom notification  Listen to the notification stream​  The NotificationsService provides the NotificationsService.notificationsStream() for any components that want to react on the event of arrival of new notification to subscribe.  In particular, it also emits a null event when notifications are deleted.  Manage user notifications​  The NotificationsService provides a variety of methods to follow and manage the state of the notification lists  haveNotifications() returns true if there are some notifications,allNotificationsShowing() returns true if all the notifications in the list are being shown on the screen,allNotificationsShowing() returns true if none of the notifications are being shown on the screen,lastNotification() returns the latest notification if any,showNotifications() shows all the notifications in the list,showNotifications() hides all notifications,deleteAllNotifications() deletes all notifications,deleteNotification(notification: Notification) deletes a specific notification,closeNotification(notification: Notification) hides a notification if it has just been created and has not been shown, otherwise deletes the notification.

The library is used in the Vanilla Builder application to let users customize the standard Vanilla Search User Interface. The goal of this library is to provide three functionalities: The ability to make a User Interface re-configurable by drag-and-dropping its components into &quot;containers&quot; (supporting multiple levels of sub-containers, allowing for arbitrary UI layouts).The ability to customize the configuration and styling of the components by clicking on them and editing their properties in a form (including helper components to generate forms easily).The ability to save the configuration of the User Interface in a JSON format and to load it back later. The configuration can also be used to generate a &quot;static&quot; Angular application (where the components are in a fixed position and not configurable any more, like in a &quot;normal&quot; Angular application).

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"ModalService​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Modal Module","url":"/sba-angular/docs/libraries/core/modal#modalservice","content":" The ModalService can be injected to your component when you need to inform user or to ask for user interaction before executing a procedure.  The service provides four public methods that creates four commonly types of popup:  ModalService.oK() is the simplest way to create an informative popup.  Example 1: a component that create a simple popup with OK button to inform user  import { Component, OnInit, Input, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core'; import { ModalService } from '@sinequa/core/modal'; @Component({ selector: 'my-component', templateUrl: './my.component.html' }) export class MyComponent { constructor(private modalService: ModalService) { } /* some component logics */ private someFunctionThatNeedsToInformUser() { this.modalService.oK('Hello world!'); } }   When the method someFunctionThatNeedsToInformUser() is called the following popup appears on the application.  Ok popup  The signature of the method is  oK( message: string, // The message to display to user, can be internationalized (i18n) message. messageParams?: MessageParams, // The format parameters for the message if i18n title?: string, // The title of the popup, could be i18n message. confirmType = ConfirmType.Success // The type of the confirmation ): Promise&lt;ModalResult&gt; // A Promise to wait for user interaction   The valid values of ConfirmType are Success, Info, Warning, Error.  The next method is ModalService.oKCancel(), which creates a popup with two buttons OK and Cancel.  The signature of the method is  oKCancel( message: string, // The message to display to user, can be internationalized (i18n) message. messageParams?: MessageParams, // The format parameters for the message if i18n title?: string, // The title of the popup, could be i18n message. confirmType = ConfirmType.Info, // The type of the confirmation primaryButton = ModalResult.OK // The primary button, ie. the auto-focused button, that will be clicked if user clicks Enter directly ): Promise&lt;ModalResult&gt; // A Promise to wait for user interaction   Example 2: A warning popup with OkCancel  this.modalService.oKCancel('Here is some important information', {}, 'Info', ConfirmType.Warning);   Which yields  Ok Cancel popup  Alternatively, the ModalService provides the method yesNo() to create a popup with two buttons Yes and No, which is essentially the same as okCancel() but with different button naming.  The signature of the method is  yesNo( message: string, // The message to display to user, can be internationalized (i18n) message. messageParams?: MessageParams, // The format parameters for the message if i18n title?: string, // The title of the popup, could be i18n message. confirmType = ConfirmType.Info, // The type of the confirmation primaryButton = ModalResult.OK // The primary button, ie. the auto-focused button, that will be clicked if user clicks Enter directly ): Promise&lt;ModalResult&gt; // A Promise to wait for user interaction   Example 3: A question popup with YesNo  this.modalService.yesNo('Do you want to perform the operation ?', {}, 'Question', ConfirmType.Info);   Which yields,  Yes No popup  Finally, if you want to create a popup that does not fit in those proposed by ModalService, you can use ModalService.confirm().  The signature of the method is  confirm( options: ConfirmOptions // The options to configure the popup modal ): Promise&lt;ModalResult&gt; // A Promise to wait for user interaction   The input of this method is a ConfirmOptions  interface ConfirmOptions { title?: string; // The title of the popup, could be i18n message. message: string; // The message to display to user, can be internationalized (i18n) message. messageParams?: MessageParams; // The format parameters for the message if i18n confirmType?: ConfirmType; // The type of the confirmation buttons: ModalButton[]; // The buttons to display on the popup }   Each button of a popup is of type ModalButton, which can be created by new ModalButtion(options).  The input of the constructor is of type IModalButton  interface IModalButton { result: ModalResult; // The result associated with the button. primary?: boolean; // Indicates whether this button is the primary button amongst a set of buttons. text?: string; // The button text. visible?: boolean; // Indicates whether the button is currently visible. validation?: FormGroup; // The validation `FormGroup` that should be tested when the button is // clicked. The button will only perform its `action` // when the validation is `valid`. anchor?: boolean; // Indicats whether the button should be rendered with an `&lt;a&gt;` tag // rather than a `&lt;button&gt;` tag. action?: (button: ModalButton) =&gt; void; // The action to perform when the button is clicked. // Buttons with `result` values other than `Custom` // also close the modal. }   Example 4: A customized popup with ModalService.confirm()  this.modalService.confirm({ title: 'Some random title', message: 'Hello world!', confirmType: ConfirmType.Info, buttons: [ new ModalButton({ text: 'Yeah wow', action: () =&gt; { }, result: ModalResult.OK }), new ModalButton({ text: 'Whatever', action: () =&gt; { }, result: ModalResult.Ignore }) ] });   Which yields,  Custom popup  All these methods are backed by ModalService.open(). All the modals displayed by ModalService.open() are dynamically created, not by including them in the HTML template of the caller component.  The signature of this method is  open( component: Type&lt;any&gt;, // The component represents the popup modal to be displayed config: ModalConfig = {} // The configuration of the popup modal ): Promise&lt;ModalResult&gt; // A Promise to wait for user interaction   The configuration of a modal is a ModalConfig  interface ModalConfig { panelClass?: string | string[]; // Classes that should be added to the `Overlay` pane. hasBackdrop?: boolean; // Indicates whether a backdrop should be added when opening the modal. backdropClass?: string | string[]; // Classes that should be added to the backdrop. model?: any; // The data model that the modal will operate on. width?: string; // The CSS width of the modal. height?: string; // The CSS height of the modal. fullscreen?: boolean; // Indicates whether the modal should occupy the screen width and height. // In this case `width` and `height` are set to `100%` // and the `sq-modal-fullscreen` class is added to `panelClass` closeOnBackdropClick?: boolean; // Indicates whether a click on the backdrop should close the modal. The default value is `true`. }   As it is shown in the signature of ModalService.open(), any component can be hoisted by this method as a popup modal in the application. The default popup component is injected via the Injection token MODAL_CONFIRM. You can change the default popup component in the Angular provider declaration of your app.module.ts.  import { /*...,*/ MODAL_CONFIRM} from &quot;@sinequa/core/modal&quot;; @NgModule({ /*....*/ providers: [ /*....*/ { provide: MODAL_CONFIRM, useValue: MyConfirmComponent } /*....*/ ], /*....*/ })   Or you can call your popup component directly with ModalService.open().  In effect, many of the popups used by Sinequa components are created using this method. Here are some examples of popup components:  Component name\tUI popupBsEditSavedQuery\tNew saved query BsManageSavedQueries\tManage saved queries BsEditAlert\tAlert BsEditBasket\tBasket  When hoisting the modal popup with your own component, you may want to transfer data back and forth with the component.  For that you need to inject MODAL_MODEL into your component, and then transfer the data object to model property when calling ModalService.open().  Example 5: transferring data to custom popup component  /********* mypopup.component.ts *********/ import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy, Inject } from &quot;@angular/core&quot;; import { MODAL_MODEL } from &quot;@sinequa/core/modal&quot;; /* ... */ @Component({ /* ... */ }) export class MyPopup implements OnInit, OnDestroy { /* ... */ constructor( /* ... */ @Inject(MODAL_MODEL) public model: SomeDataObject, /* ... */ ) { /* ... */ } /* ... */ } /********* some component calling mypopup.component.ts *********/ import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy, Inject } from &quot;@angular/core&quot;; import { ModalService, ModalResult, ModalConfig } from &quot;@sinequa/core/modal&quot;; import { MyPopup, SomeDataObject } from &quot;the/path/to/mypopup&quot;; /* ... */ @Component({ /* ... */ }) export class MyComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy { /* ... */ constructor( /* ... */ private modalService: ModalService, /* ... */ ) { /* ... */ } private callMyPopup(): Promise&lt;void&gt; { const data: SomeDataObject = { /* ... */ }; const modalConfig: ModalConfig = { /* ... */ model: data, /* ... */ } this.modalService .open(MyPopup, modalConfig) .then((popupResult: ModalResult) =&gt; { switch (modalResult) { /* react to the modal result*/ } }); } /* ... */ }  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"11.6.0","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sba-angular/docs/releases/release-11-6-0","content":"11.6.0 See on Github General refactoring of the SBA libraries: The @sinequa/components library has been refactored as 2 libraries (@sinequa/components and @sinequa/analytics).

See the official migration guide. ⚠️ However, you may encounter difficulties with your dependencies. We recommend completely deleting your node_modules folder, running npm clean cache and reinstalling it from scratch (npm install). If possible, use our provided package.json and package-lock.json as is. If you have modified these files (to install libraries), make sure to update your versions to reflect the changes we have made (like removing d3-format or setting specific versions of certain libraries).  ⚠️ Code duplications: To minimize duplication of code between Vanilla and Pepper, we modified Pepper to reference files in the Vanilla project (like the search form, autocomplete and various stylesheets). Files are typically referenced with &quot;@sinequa/vanilla&quot; (an alias added in pepper/tsconfig.json). If you use the Pepper sample application you may either use this new structure (modify files in the Vanilla Search project), or use the legacy structure. A drawback of using the legacy structure is that your application will not be updated when we release new versions (only the Vanilla Search code will be updated).  Icons and logos: We updated Sinequa icons and logos across our applications and documentation.  The loading screens (defined in index.html) now use inline styles rather than Bootstrap to avoid a positioning glitch on start-up.  A new documentation page (Speed and Performance) explains how to use module lazy loading to speed-up complex applications (typically with multiple routes and &quot;heavy&quot; components).

Components  New Sinequa Theme packaged under @sinequa/components/theme. The theme is a set of modular stylesheets that can be imported indidividually or as a whole in an application's global stylesheet. The theme modifies the appearance of standard Bootstrap components and specific Sinequa components. See https://sinequa.github.io/sba-angular/modules/components/theme.htmlWe refactored the components in the @sinequa/components/machine-learning library, following new Neural Search features and modified web services (breaking change). These components (showing answers, top passages, and matching passages per document) are all integrated by default in Vanilla Search. See https://sinequa.github.io/sba-angular/modules/components/machine-learning.htmlPreview library: Simplification of the sq-facet-preview-2 component (breaking change): This component now only manages the preview itself, and does not display the document metadata or document title. (In Vanilla Search the metadata and title are now displayed via the facet-card itself)Fixed navigation issues (eg. 2 clicks required to go back to the search view)Fixed SVG highlights in documents generated by certain converters Facet library: Facet card: Various additions to the sq-facet-card API (See https://sinequa.github.io/sba-angular/modules/components/facet.html). These new features are used in the new &quot;Mini-Preview&quot; of Vanilla Search and should be used more generally for displaying complex components with multiple views, actions and options. Natively support multiple views. These views are injected within ng-template elements decorated with a directive sqFacetView. The facet-card displays a list of actions to toggle between the views, in the bottom-left corner of the facet card header.Support primary actions (shown in the header top-right corner) and secondary actions (shown in the header bottom-right corner).The 3 action groups (views, primary, secondary) can be completely and independently customized (size, styles, positioning, etc.)The custom ng-templates (for the header, sub-header, footer and settings) that a facet component could already declare in its own template, can now be injected into the sq-facet-card directly (thus removing complexity from child components and opening more possibilities for the parent components). Facet-list and facet-tree: Refreshed look &amp; feel and checkboxes to make multiple selection more intuitive. We also added the option to display the search bar permanently.Facet-range: The min/max inputs now accept given number and Date inputs Metadata library: We removed the separator in &quot;inline&quot; mode (as opposed to &quot;tabular&quot;).Result source component: We changed the treepath separator to a prettier one (❯) and made it easier to customize the component styles.Result counter: Prevent text wrappingUser menu: We now show the user's full name if available, but it is only visible as a tooltip and within the dropdown menu's header. It is possible to display the user name as before, by passing [showText]=&quot;true&quot; to the component.Modal component: Modals now respect the height/width/fullscreen settings available in the modal service.New sq-scope component (packaged in @sinequa/components/search) to toggle between &quot;search scopes&quot; defined in the query web service. The component is integrated in the default search-form component packaged in Vanilla-Search (but it is visible only if scopes are actually configured).SearchService: We made this service (along with the QueryWebService and Breadcrumbs) generic with respect to the Results type, so that it can be easily customized for a custom index schema. (eg. inject SearchService&lt;MyResults&gt; in your component, where MyResults includes all your custom metadata).Sponsored links: handle link URL when it contains %PREVIEW_URL%Fixed broken ClickOutside directive  Analytics  New multi-level pie chart component to display tree-typed metadata. See https://sinequa.github.io/sba-angular/modules/analytics/fusioncharts.htmlImproved the API of the Tooltip component used in the analytics views (heatmap, timeline, money charts...), resulting in simplified and consistent usage across these components. The tooltip is now in its own library: @sinequa/analytics/tooltipMade the timeline tooltip scroll vertically, when too many values.Fixed the heatmap component in cooccurrence modeFixed the ngx-chart legend in dark mode  Vanilla Search  The new Sinequa Theme is used by default in Vanilla-Search.The &quot;mini-preview&quot; (displayed along the results) uses the simplified version of the facet-preview component and improved facet-card API, supporting multiple views (see above).When Neural Search is active, the mini-preview displays two views: Preview and Passages (from the machine learning package). This list of views can be easily customized by adding/removing ng-templates in the facet card.The metadata component is displayed with [tabular]=&quot;false&quot; by default, to save space in the mini preview header.A placeholder card is displayed on the right side when no preview is opened, to encourage a click on a document from the user.Refactored the application navbar to match the grid layout of the main app content.Fixed scrolling to bottom when returning to the home page ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"General changes","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sba-angular/docs/releases/release-11-8-0","content":"See on Github General changes Removed support for Internet Explorer from browserslist fileUpgrade to ngx-bootstrap v8Migration from ng5-slider to angular-sliderRefactoring of proxy config files to group all the endpoints togetherAdded &quot;override&quot; keyword from typescript 4.3 to improve type checkingFixed Bootstrap btn-light class (hover and active effects invisible when the button is on a bg-light background)Fixed some remaining Bootstrap v5 utilities (font-style -&gt; fst, font-weight -&gt; fw...)

Previously, these components were limited to predefined facet types, namely sq-facet-list and sq-facet-tree and predefined parameter names. Now, these containers can display any type of facet components, including custom ones. This change requires a migration of the facet configuration objects (defined by default in the config.ts files): The FacetConfig&lt;T&gt; is now parametric, requiring developers to specify what kind of configuration they contain (eg. FacetConfig&lt;FacetListParams&gt; for an sq-facet-list component. Please refer to the documentation of this module for more information.allowAnd option added to the sq-facet-tree (same usage as for sq-facet-list)Prevent sequential clicks in the sq-facet-tree to be merged with ORProper wrapping of the list of filters in the sq-facet-filters components, when there are too many filters to display on one line.Fixed wrong number of items in facets (by default 11 instead of 10)Fixed bug with null value selection in distributions Search library (@sinequa/components/search): When an http search request fails, stop the loading animationTabs (sq-tabs): Made the display of counters optional (showCounts parameter) Preview library (@sinequa/components/preview): Display the link to the PDF version of the file, when availableFixed issue with the navigation history (requiring double clicks of the back button)FIxed issue with minimap when there are no extract to display Utils library (@sinequa/components/utils): Added fallback positions (fallbackPlacements) to the sq-tooltip directiveSaved queries library (@sinequa/components/saved-queries): Prevent app from breaking if multiple query exports are definedAutocomplete library (@sinequa/components/autocomplete): Removed parsing of the query when fielded search if offRecent documents &amp;

The new syntax essentially provides the same level of functionality:  Before expr = this.exprBuilder.concatAndExpr([ this.exprBuilder.makeExpr(&quot;docformat&quot;, &quot;pdf&quot;), this.exprBuilder.concatOrExpr([ this.exprBuilder.makeExpr(&quot;authors&quot;, &quot;John&quot;), this.exprBuilder.makeNumericalExpr(&quot;size&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot;, 1024) ]) ]); query.addSelect(expr);   After filter = { operator: &quot;and&quot;, filters: [ { field: &quot;docformat&quot;, value: &quot;pdf&quot; }, { operator: &quot;or&quot;, filters: [ { field: &quot;authors&quot;, value: &quot;John&quot; }, { field: &quot;size&quot;, operator: &quot;&lt;&quot;, value: 1024 } ] } ] }; query.addFilter(filter);   Dataset web service: New isDatasetError(result) method to easily test whether a result returned by the dataset web service is valid.The get(webService, dataset) now throws an error if the result is not a valid dataset, and its return signature has therefore been changed to Observable&lt;Results&gt;.The getAll() method is removed. Use getBulk() without specifying any dataset instead. The Json Method web service now has proper typing for the options argument, enables typing the return type and does not log the response to the console anymore.

A better alternative is to intercept audit events globally (just before they are sent to the server) and modify them all in this centralized location. This can be achieved by extending the standard AuditInterceptor and overriding the updateAuditRecord() method.  HTTP interceptors are a standard way to manipulate HTTP requests and responses globally in Angular. Sinequa includes an interceptor dedicated to audit events.

Google the error message. It's unlikely you are the only person having that problem. Google is likely to give you a lot of ideas on how to deal with the problem. However, some errors are too generic and don't put you in the right direction. Look at the linked source, if any. An error message often has a source file and line number linked on the right: If the source file is one of yours, it probably contains the error. If it is an Angular file, it probably means you misused an Angular feature at some point. You can also open a specific source file of your app (or from the Sinequa libraries) by exploring the tree in the Source tab. The sources of your app are normally under webpack:// &gt; . &gt; src, and the (compiled) sources of the Sinequa libraries under webpack:// &gt; C:\\... &gt; dist &gt; components/fesm2015 In the source, add a breakpoint before the point where the app failed and refresh your app to reach that breakpoint. When your app reached the breakpoint and paused, there are many things that you can try, such as: Looking for the values of variables in the scope, simply by hovering your mouse over these variables in the source code.Run JavaScript commands in the Console (you have access to the scope of the breakpoint).Keep executing the app step by step (buttons on the right). Look for failures in the Network tab. Failures are indicated in red. You often want to filter for XHR requests, which correspond to the interactions with the API (all the static resources are hidden). Both the requests and responses may contain interesting information. Inspect the state of your Angular component. You can easily select an Angular component by clicking on it in the Elements tab (and/or by use the selection tool). In the example above, the Angular component are easy to spot: they are the ones with non-standard HTML names (like &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, etc.), and generally have a prefix (&lt;sq-...&gt; for Sinequa components, &lt;app-...&gt; for the components of your app). When an element is selected, you can access it with $0 in the console. If the selected element is an Angular component, you can get the instance of this component by typing ng.getComponent($0), which gives you access to all its fields and properties.

For example, if you want to base your project on the Vanilla Search application, simply copy and rename the Vanilla Search project. You will also need to copy (and rename) the project declared in the angular.json file, and add a build command to the package.json file.  At this point the project is a clone of Vanilla Search.  Now the key difference between an &quot;Application project&quot; and an &quot;Elements project&quot; is what happens on startup. If you have a look at the main.ts file, you can see that it does essentially one thing: Bootstrap your AppModule (defined in app.module.ts). And if you look at the AppModule, you can see that it declares one bootstrap component, the AppComponent.  See the documentation of the bootstrap property:  bootstrap: The main application view, called the root component, which hosts all other app views. Only the root NgModule should set the bootstrap property.  In the case of an Angular Elements project, we do not want an application main view, and so we can remove the bootstrap property.  While we are at it, we can also completely remove the AppComponent from the rest of project (along with the other unneeded components from the original application). You can also remove the &lt;app&gt; element from the index.html file.  Instead of this bootstrap property, we are going to customize our AppModule class by adding a ngDoBootstrap() method where we declare the component(s) which we want to &quot;export&quot; as Custom Element(s):  import { NgModule, Injector} from &quot;@angular/core&quot;; import { createCustomElement } from '@angular/elements'; ... @NgModule({ imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule, ... ], declarations: [ SearchFormComponent, AutocompleteExtended, ... ], providers: [ ... ], //bootstrap: [ // AppComponent //] }) export class AppModule { constructor(private injector: Injector){ } ngDoBootstrap() { const searchForm = createCustomElement(SearchFormComponent, { injector: this.injector }); customElements.define('my-search-form', searchForm); } }   Now, you can build your application as usual with ng build. The output in the dist/ folder looks similar to a regular application build. The difference is you can now take the generated javascript files (main, polyfills and runtime), and put them into a different application. In order to instantiate your Angular component(s), simply use the name you defined in the ngDoBoostrap() method (note that this NOT the Angular selector of the component):  &lt;body&gt; ... &lt;my-search-form&gt;&lt;/my-search-form&gt; ... &lt;script src=&quot;runtime-es2015.js&quot; type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;polyfills-es2015.js&quot; type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;main-es2015.js&quot; type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt;   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Other considerations​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Exporting Standalone Components","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tipstricks/export-standalone#other-considerations","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Inputs and Outputs​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Exporting Standalone Components","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tipstricks/export-standalone#inputs-and-outputs","content":" Note that it is also possible to pass inputs and listen to outputs to/from the element, much like in Angular, but now using native Browser syntax (See Mappings).

There are many samples of charts available on the Internet, which can be reused in an Angular application.  Most charting libraries, like ngx-charts or Highcharts, package many pre-defined charts that can be configured with a bunch of options. The problem with this approach is that there are many degrees of freedom when building an interactive chart, and no amount of options can handle them all. At some point you will need to do something that wasn't forseen by the component's designer.  For this reason, D3 does not package any pre-defined chart. Instead, it packages many primitives and algorithms to efficiently build exactly the custom chart that you need. This approach is very powerful, especially when looking at the huge variety of D3's gallery of visualization, none looking like another.  The drawback is that D3 is difficult to learn and to use. Even after working with it for a long time, you can be easily confused by its complex code, especially when charts grow in complexity (multiple &quot;behaviors&quot;, transition, update mechanism, etc.).  If you want to learn about D3, their latest tutorial covers a lot of the key concepts and can be done completely online.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"D3 concepts​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Combining D3 and Angular","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tipstricks/d3-angular#d3-concepts","content":" D3 essentially draws charts as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and everything revolves around modifying these SVG and listening to users mouse and keyboard interactions on these SVG.  It is important to be relatively familiar with the SVG language to understand D3 generally and this page in particular.  For example, the following SVG code renders as follow:  &lt;svg width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #eee;&quot;&gt; &lt;rect x=&quot;30&quot; y=&quot;100&quot; width=&quot;50&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; fill=&quot;#d00&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt; &lt;rect x=&quot;80&quot; y=&quot;50&quot; width=&quot;50&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; fill=&quot;#0d0&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt; &lt;rect x=&quot;130&quot; y=&quot;20&quot; width=&quot;50&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; fill=&quot;#00d&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt; &lt;/svg&gt;   &lt;svg width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #eee;&quot;&gt; &lt;rect x=&quot;30&quot; y=&quot;100&quot; width=&quot;50&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; fill=&quot;#d00&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt; &lt;rect x=&quot;80&quot; y=&quot;50&quot; width=&quot;50&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; fill=&quot;#0d0&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt; &lt;rect x=&quot;130&quot; y=&quot;20&quot; width=&quot;50&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; fill=&quot;#00d&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt; &lt;/svg&gt;   This is exactly the kind of SVG that D3 can generate, except of course it normally generates them with JavaScript code.  In most examples you see online, the SVG actually starts empty and is populated with elements programmatically.  For example, to reproduce the example above:  &lt;!-- An empty SVG --&gt; &lt;svg id=&quot;my-svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;script&gt; const svg = d3.select(&quot;#my-svg&quot;) .attr(&quot;width&quot;, 200) // Set the attributes of the SVG element .attr(&quot;height&quot;, 200) .style(&quot;background-color&quot;, &quot;#eee&quot;); svg.append(&quot;rect&quot;) // Create a &lt;rect&gt; element .attr(&quot;x&quot;, 10) // Set each attribute of the new &lt;rect element&gt; .attr(&quot;y&quot;, 100) .attr(&quot;width&quot;, 50) .attr(&quot;height&quot;, 80) .attr(&quot;fill&quot;, &quot;#d00&quot;); // etc. for the 2 other rects &lt;/script&gt;   Of course, in practice what you want to plot on the screen is data, which unfortunately is not measured on a scale of pixels. So we need to somehow transform our data into proportionate numbers for our x, y, width, height, and even fill attributes. This is where D3 starts to come in handy, with the concept of Scale (See d3-scale).  Let's say the data from the chart above is in fact defined as below:  const data = [ {label: 'banana', value: 0.8}, {label: 'apple', value: 1.3}, {label: 'strawberry', value: 1.6} ];   Let's refactor the example above using D3 scales:  // Create a scale for the X axis, that maps each label to a range of pixels const xScale = d3.scaleBand() .domain(data.map(d =&gt; d.label)) // ['banana', 'apple', 'strawberry'] .range([30, 190]) // The first bar will start at 30px, and the last will end at 190px // Create a scale for the Y axis, that maps each numerical value to a pixel dimension const yScale = d3.scaleLinear() .domain([0, d3.max(data, d =&gt; d.value)]) // The Y axis will always start at 0 .range([180, 20]) // The 0 is mapped to 180px (the bottom of the chart - 20px for margin) and the max is mapped to 20px (the height of the chart + 20px for margin) // Create a scale for the colors. Each index will yield a different color const colorScale = d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory10); // Now we can build our &lt;rect&gt; in a for-loop! for(let i=0; i&lt;data.length; i++) { svg.append(&quot;rect&quot;) .attr(&quot;x&quot;, xScale(data[i].label)) .attr(&quot;y&quot;, yScale(data[i].value)) .attr(&quot;width&quot;, xScale.bandwidth()) .attr(&quot;height&quot;, yScale(0) - yScale(data[i].value)) .attr(&quot;fill&quot;, colorScale(i)); }   This generates the following SVG:    Note that the code above generalizes for any amount and scale of data and SVG dimensions.  If you are familiar with D3, the for-loop probably looks at bit strange to you. Indeed, the idiomatic way of writing it with D3 would be instead:  svg.selectAll(&quot;.bar&quot;) .data(data) // We are &quot;attaching&quot; the data to DOM elements .enter() // Here we select only the elements that enter the DOM .append(&quot;rect&quot;) // For each new element, we insert a &lt;rect&gt; .attr(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;) .attr(&quot;x&quot;, d =&gt; xScale(d.label)) // Works as before, except we access the data with arrow functions .attr(&quot;y&quot;, d =&gt; yScale(d.value)) .attr(&quot;width&quot;, xScale.bandwidth()) .attr(&quot;height&quot;, d =&gt; yScale(0) - yScale(d.value)) .attr(&quot;fill&quot;, (d,i) =&gt; colorScale(i));   This syntax is a lot more powerful for reasons that become clear when you use more advanced features of D3.  While we're here, let's use D3's axes primitives to nicely visualize our labels and numerical values:  svg.append(&quot;g&quot;) // Create a new &lt;g&gt; element .attr(&quot;transform&quot;, `translate(0, 180)`) // Move it to the bottom .call(d3.axisBottom(xScale)); // Turn it into an axis svg.append(&quot;g&quot;) // Create a new &lt;g&gt; element .attr(&quot;transform&quot;, `translate(30, 0)`) // Move it to the left of the chart .call(d3.axisLeft(yScale)); // Turn it into an axis     This is D3's most basic example. There are many other primitives and algorithms, but in the end it always comes down to manipulating the DOM in an efficient way.  But, let's stop here for a second... Because Angular is also really good at manipulating the DOM. Unlike D3, Angular does not force you to create and modify every DOM element programmatically by writing JavaScript. Instead, Angular uses a template language which manages a lot of the functionalities of D3 selections, but in a way that is a lot more expressive and pleasant.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Leveraging Angular​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Combining D3 and Angular","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tipstricks/d3-angular#leveraging-angular","content":" Instead of creating our &lt;rect&gt; elements programmatically, let's use Angular's template language:  &lt;svg width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #eee;&quot;&gt; &lt;rect *ngFor=&quot;let d of data; let i=index&quot; [attr.x]=&quot;xScale(d.label)&quot; [attr.y]=&quot;yScale(d.value)&quot; [attr.width]=&quot;xScale.bandwidth()&quot; [attr.height]=&quot;yScale(0) - yScale(d.value)&quot; [attr.fill]=&quot;colorScale(i)&quot;&gt; &lt;/rect&gt; &lt;/svg&gt;   This descriptive approach has various advantages:  It is a lot more expressive than the equivalent code based on d3.select(). What you see is what you get. There is no risk of forgetting to call a .select() or an .append(). A new developer reading this understands immediately what is going on.This code updates automatically and efficiently when the data and scales change. Angular takes care of adding or remove the necessary DOM elements for you, whereas the equivalent task is non-trivial when you need to do it programmatically.This removes a significant part of the code from your component and makes it easier to debug and maintain.  Let's see how this component's controller looks like:  @Component({ selector: 'my-chart', templateUrl: 'my-chart.html' // Template shown above }) export class MyChart { @Input() data; xScale = d3.scaleBand().range([30, 190]); yScale = d3.scaleLinear().range([180, 20]); colorScale = d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory10); /** * When the data changes, we only need to update our scales, * and the template will magically update! * */ ngOnChanges() { this.xScale.domain(this.data.map(d =&gt; d.label)); this.yScale.domain([0, d3.max(this.data, d =&gt; d.value)]); } }   You'll notice the chart does not contain axes. This is because axes are complex and cannot be easily replaced by Angular template syntax. However, we can still leverage Angular to simplify things.  Let's start by adding and positioning the two &lt;g&gt; elements that will contain the X and Y axes:  &lt;svg width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #eee;&quot;&gt; &lt;rect *ngFor=&quot;let d of data; let i=index&quot; [attr.x]=&quot;xScale(d.label)&quot; ...&gt; &lt;/rect&gt; &lt;g #xAxis transform=&quot;translate(0, 180)&quot;&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g #yAxis transform=&quot;translate(30, 0)&quot;&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;/svg&gt;   Notice the #xAxis and #yAxis identifiers. We can use them to retrieve these elements in the controller:  @ViewChild(&quot;xAxis&quot;) gx: ElementRef; @ViewChild(&quot;yAxis&quot;) gy: ElementRef;   Now we can draw our axes with:  drawAxes() { d3.select(this.gx.nativeElement) .call(d3.axisBottom(this.xScale)); d3.select(this.gy.nativeElement) .call(d3.axisLeft(this.yScale)); }   However, there is an issue here: The gx and gy elements will be undefined until the DOM is first rendered, and ngOnChanges() gets called before that! This is why we need to use ngAfterViewInit(), which runs once after the template is first rendered:  ngOnChanges() { this.xScale.domain(this.data.map(d =&gt; d.label)); this.yScale.domain([0, d3.max(this.data, d =&gt; d.value)]); if(this.gx){ // We draw the axes unless the view hasn't yet been rendered this.drawAxes(); } } ngOnAfterViewInit() { if(this.data) { // We draw the axes if there's any data (ie. the scales have been initialized in ngOnChanges()) this.drawAxes(); } }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Methodology​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Combining D3 and Angular","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tipstricks/d3-angular#methodology","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"1) Component scope​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Combining D3 and Angular","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tipstricks/d3-angular#1-component-scope","content":" In Angular you can design tiny components that do very few things or large components that do a lot of things.

The most simple ones are CSS effects applied on hover. These effects can be animated with transitions. For example:  .line { opacity: 0.6; } .line:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 0.2s ease-in 0s; }   Then there are effects that require event listeners and callbacks. Here we can use typical event listeners, such as (mouseenter), (mousemove), (mouseleave) or (click). For example, we can listen to a user click on a bar (of the bar chart from our first example).  &lt;rect *ngFor=&quot;let d of data; let i=index&quot; [attr.x]=&quot;xScale(d.label)&quot; [attr.y]=&quot;yScale(d.value)&quot; [attr.width]=&quot;xScale.bandwidth()&quot; [attr.height]=&quot;yScale(0) - yScale(d.value)&quot; [attr.fill]=&quot;colorScale(i)&quot; (click)=&quot;onClick(d)&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- Notice the (click) callback --&gt; &lt;/rect&gt;   And in the controller:  onClick(d: {label: string, value: number}) { // We can do anything with the data that was clicked on! // Including modifying the data itself, which would cause the view to be redrawn. console.log(d); }   Then, there are more complex interactions, like D3 zoom, brush or drag, which involve multiple listeners (to monitor mouse wheel, mouse click, movement, etc.). These interactions cannot be easily implemented in our template. Like the axes in the example above, we need to apply these behaviors programmatically to an existing DOM element.  For example, we can create a zoom behavior, and apply it to our SVG element:  &lt;svg #mysvg&gt; ... &lt;/svg&gt;   With:  @ViewChild(&quot;mysvg&quot;) svg; ngOnAfterViewInit() { // We create a Zoom behavior and apply it to the SVG element // The onZoom method is called when the user &quot;zooms&quot; (scroll with the mouse wheel) over the SVG const zoom = d3.zoom() .on(&quot;zoom&quot;, () =&gt; this.onZoom()); d3.select(this.svg.nativeElement) .call(zoom); } onZoom() { const transform = d3.zoomTransform(this.svg.nativeElement); // The transform object allows us to either transform elements directly // For example: d3.select(svg).attr(&quot;transform&quot;, transform) // Or modify our scales, which will redraw the shapes in our template automatically this.x = transform.rescaleX(this.x); // Since we modify the X axis, we do need to redraw the axis programmatically // (because they axes are created programmatically in the first place, not via templating) d3.select(this.xAxis.nativeElement) .call(d3.axisBottom(this.x)); }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"6) Transitions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Combining D3 and Angular","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tipstricks/d3-angular#6-transitions","content":" D3 also provides a powerful API for transitioning elements smoothly between states. For example, when the data changes, you may want to animate the shapes (lines, paths, etc.) from their previous locations to the new ones. If the scale is changed following the data change, you would also animate the axes.  For example:  // We modify the X scale because of new data this.x.domain([newMin, newMax]); d3.select(this.xAxis.nativeElement) // Select the axis .transition() // Create a transition .duration(1000) // Which lasts for 1000ms .call(d3.axisBottom(this.x)); // Animate the axis from its current state to the new state (using the updated X domain).   Unfortunately transitions can only be applied to D3 selections, which at first seems like this approach is incompatible with the declarative approach described above.  Note that Angular also has a transition API which can be used to transition between different states. This approach can be quite powerful, but it is limited to CSS styles,(for example transitioning from opacity 0 to 1 when an element is created). It doesn't seem currently possible to transition attributes, like the x and y coordinates of SVG primitives.  There is a workaround to apply a real D3 transition to the elements declared in our Angular template. Notice that the elements depend on the scale objects. So every time we modify a scale, Angular redraws the elements. In the example above we change the scale instantaneously, which means the elements transition instantaneously too. But it is possible to modify the scale at every step of the transition, which means Angular will update our SVG elements at every step too!  This looks as follows (using the same example as before):  // Store the old domain const oldDomain = this.x.domain(); // We modify the X scale because of new data this.x.domain([newMin, newMax]); // Create an interpolator for our domain const interpolator = d3.interpolateArray(oldDomain, this.x.domain()); d3.select(this.xAxis.nativeElement) // Select the axis .transition() // Create a transition .duration(1000) // Which lasts for 1000ms .tween(&quot;domain interpolation&quot;, () =&gt; (t) =&gt; { this.x.domain(interpolator(t)); // At every step of the transition we update the X scale's domain }) .call(d3.axisBottom(this.x)); // Animate the axis from its current state to the new state (using the updated X domain).   With the above workaround, not only is the X axis smoothly transitioning between 2 domains, but also will any shape which directly or indirectly depends on the x scale!  As a last recommendation, be careful to never mix transitions and User interactions. If you start a transition, but in the meantime the user can zoom in and out, moving some elements, you will most definitely have a conflict, which may result in an unknown intermediate state.  If your chart contains interactions and transitions, be sure to turn off interactions before starting the transitions and turn them back on after.

The Query web service has a rich API which can be used in many different ways. Unlike other plugins, the QueryPlugin is NOT a class with blank hook methods called by the main web service. Instead, the plugin class implements a large part of the logic of the web service, and this QueryPlugin class is always used by the web service, even when you don't create a plugin. When you do create a QueryPlugin, you are overriding the service's behavior directly (not just hooking into it).  It is also important to know that other web services make use of the QueryPlugin. For example the Query Export web service need to fetch data in a way that is consistent with the Query web service, before exporting that data.  The QueryPlugin has many methods which can be overriden, and we cannot go in the details of all of them here. However, we can split these methods in the following categories:  Initialization: These methods initialize the properties of the QueryPlugin class in function of the user's query. The query object sent by the client corresponds to the Query type, which is used throughout the SBA framework.Before Search: These methods can be overriden to modify the way the SQL query is built (eg. to add, remove or modify specific SQL clauses).After Search: These methods can be overriden to post-process the results of the SQL query and/or modify how these results are writen in the JSON response.  The complete API of the QueryPlugin is listed on Sinequa's documentation website.  Note that within a QueryPlugin, you have access to various useful objects, in particular:  this.Request: The query object (a Json object) that this web service is responding to. It is possible to access any sub property of the query (which can include non-standard properties, added specifically for the purpose of customization).this.Response: The response returned by the web service (a Json object). It is possible to modify any property of this response. Note that, depending on the method you override, this.Response might not always have the same content (for example, if you override a &quot;before search&quot; method, the response does not contain any data yet).

By default, only administrators are allowed to use these plugins, but it is possible to change this rule by overriding the GetRequiredAuthLevel() method:  public override JsonMethodAuthLevel GetRequiredAuthLevel() { return JsonMethodAuthLevel.User; // Any authenticated user can use the plugin }   There are four levels: User, Admin, AdminOrDelegatedAdmin and None. Note that it is possible to retrieve the user's identity via this.Session.User. Additionally, this.Session has the following properties indicating whether the current user is an admin or delegated admin: IsAdmin, IsDelegatedAdmin, and IsAdminOrDelegatedAdmin .

Authentication can be managed either by Sinequa or by the web server (IIS):  Sinequa handles authentication for Login/Password, SAML2 and OAuth2 (IIS is configured with Anonymous authentication, meaning it just lets requests go through to Sinequa). IIS handles authentication for Windows Single Sign On (NTLM or Kerberos protocols). In this case, Sinequa lets IIS do all the work, and it gets the user's id from IIS itself (LOGON_USER variable). 🛈 In that sense, Windows authentication is convenient. However, it can also prove to work erratically, and differently from one browser to the other. We generally recommend using more modern protocols like SAML2 or OAuth2.  When Sinequa handles authentication rather than IIS (normal situation), it emits a JSON Web Token (JWT) that the SBA stores in a cookie (sinequa-web-token or sinequa-web-token-secure, depending on the protocol). The settings for the JWT are found in the Webapp settings (Advanced tab). In particular it is possible to increase the life span of the tokens and to automatically refresh them, to let the user be authenticated for a longer period.    The JWT is sent with every HTTP(S) request via the sinequa-web-token cookie. This allows Sinequa to know the identity of the user. When the token expires, Sinequa returns 401 errors (Unauthorized). Upon receiving this error, the SBA re-initiates the authentication process (the user does not see these errors because they are intercepted by the LoginInterceptor provided in the @sinequa/core/login library).  In the case of the SAML or OAuth protocols, an external service must authenticate the user. The browser navigates out of the SBA to this Identity Provider (for example, Google's Single Sign On). Then the browser navigates back to the Sinequa server, which redirects again to the Sinequa SBA, while delivering the JWT cookie.  The general login process is depicted in the following diagram (depending on the authentication protocol, only a subset of this diagram is relevant for a given application):  Red boxes represents calls to Sinequa web services  Notice that the Login process includes a call to three web services: app (configuration of the app and its web services), principal (identity of the user, typically from a directory), usersettings (user data, including baskets, saved queries, etc.). The login process is considered complete when all 3 services have downloaded this data and are initialized.

CORS is active when a request is sent to a URL with an origin different from the URL in the browser. For example:  If your website is hosted on https://example.com/myapp and makes a HTTP GET request to https://example.com/api/examples/42, the two URLs have the same origin, so CORS is not active.If your website is hosted on https://example.com/myapp and makes a HTTP GET request to https://cool-service.com/api/examples/42, the two URLs have a different origin, so CORS is active.  The problem with CORS is that, when active, the browser restricts a number of functionalities. For example, in some cases it is not possible to store cookies (that are used for authentication) and it is not possible to interact with iFrames (that are used for document previews).  CORS may be an issue depending on where your SBA is deployed:  When your SBA is deployed on a Sinequa WebApp, there is no problem because CORS is not active: The application's URL (https://my-sinequa-server.com/app/my-sba) has the same origin as the application's API (https://my-sinequa-server.com/api). However, if your SBA is deployed on a different domain (https://my-app-server.com), CORS is active and you might run into some issues, which can interfere with the login process (particularly with HTTP instead of HTTPS). When the SBA is hosted on a different server, the url of the Sinequa server must be specified in the StartConfig object (defined in app.module.ts): export const startConfig: StartConfig = { app: &quot;my-app&quot;, url: &quot;https://my-sinequa-server.com&quot;, production: environment.production }; Another case where CORS can be active is during the development of the app. Using ng serve means your app is deployed on a local server (by default http://localhost:4200), but the Sinequa API is somewhere else (for example https://my-sinequa-server.com/api). Since this is a common situation, Angular CLI includes a way to proxy the Sinequa API as if it were hosted on the development server. Instead of running ng serve my-app, we simply run ng serve my-app --proxyConfig=./path/to/proxy.json, with a proxy file looking as follows: proxy.json { &quot;/api&quot;: { &quot;target&quot;: &quot;https://my-sinequa-server.com&quot;, &quot;secure&quot;: false, &quot;changeOrigin&quot;: true } } When this proxy is enabled, requests that are sent to http://localhost:4200/api are forwarded to https://my-sinequa-server.com/api. From the browser's point of view, everything comes from http://localhost:4200 (both the app and the API), so CORS is not active.  note Note that when the URL of the server is defined in a proxy file, it should not be defined in StartConfig object. In fact if you define a url in your StartConfig, it cancels the effect of the proxy: the requests will be sent to the url, thus activating CORS.

So effectively, it is not possible to store our JWT with HTTP + CORS.  Windows Authentication does not require storing a JWT, so it is not affected by this problem.  Note that with HTTP the cookie storing the JWT is named sinequa-web-token, and with HTTPS it is named sinequa-web-token-secure.  In development mode, with ng serve, you can serve your application over HTTPS with the --ssl=true option. You should generally use this option if your Sinequa backend is served over HTTPS too, even though it is not mandatory (except for SAML authentication for example).

In the background, this is the process that is active:    Notice that on application startup, the calls to the 3 web services (app, usersettings and principal) fail with a 401 error: This is what triggers the display of the login popup asking for your credentials. These errors are invisible to the user because the LoginInterceptor (on the left) has taken care of them. But if you have a look at the browser's inspector, you should see them nevertheless:    To set-up authentication via the default form, you must do the following:  On the Sinequa server, do not configure any auto-login method in the webapp. In IIS, only enable Anonymous Authentication.

One benefit of this approach is that all the work is managed by the Web Server (IIS). Therefore the application can send HTTP requests directly, without having to respond to 401 errors or exit the application.  The process is very much simplified:    The configuration of Windows SSO is documented in the official documentation.  If the SSO works for accessing the Sinequa administration, it should work for authenticating HTTP requests for a SBA deployed on the same WebApp.  Sometimes, however, the browser might prompt you for your credentials:    This can happen for various reasons, and can be quite erratic:  The application may not be recognized as part of the intranet, and thus the credentials are not transmitted. To solve this, add the application URL to your Control Panel &gt; Internet Options &gt; Security &gt; Local Intranet &gt; Sites &gt; Advanced.The problem may occur for the first requests, but after refreshing the page and/or cancelling the prompt, the problem eventually goes away (a symptom of this can be seen in you browser inspector (Network tab): sometimes some requests are successful (200) but others fail (401), causing the prompt).

Servers can also inform clients whether &quot;credentials&quot; (such as Cookies and HTTP Authentication) should be sent with requests. When you fire an AJAX call to Sinequa REST API, two HTTP queries are sent (this is automatically done by your browser): The &quot;preflight&quot; : Using OPTION Method, will get the list of Access-Control-Allow in order to know if it can go to step #2.

To use the UIService, do the following:  First, inject the screen sizes you want to use in your app.module.ts (unless you are fine with the defaults): app.module.ts import { SCREEN_SIZE_RULES } from '@sinequa/components/utils'; ... // Screen size breakpoints (must be consistent with Bootstrap custom breakpoints in styles/app.scss) export const breakpoints = { lg: &quot;(min-width: 1000px)&quot;, sm: &quot;(min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 999px)&quot;, xs: &quot;(max-width: 599px)&quot;, } ... providers: [ ... {provide: SCREEN_SIZE_RULES, useValue: breakpoints} ], Import the UIService and inject it in your component's constructor: import { UIService } from '@sinequa/components/utils'; ... constructor( ... public ui: UIService ) Use the service in your HTML templates and/or TypeScript controllers: &lt;div *ngIf=&quot;ui.screenSizeIsGreaterOrEqual('lg')&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; if(ui.screenSizeIsGreaterOrEqual('lg')){ ... }  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Query Intent Detection","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tipstricks/query-intent","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Query Intent Web Service​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Query Intent Detection","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tipstricks/query-intent#query-intent-web-service","content":" This functionality is exposed as a web service.

It is automatically triggered when you configure a Query Intent Set in your query web service on the back-end.  However, there are two possible processes:  Asynchronous detection (by default): The Query Intent detection is performed in parallel with Search. This process is well suited when query intent is needed for displaying information in addition to the search results, like for example in an info-card. This process is analogous to how sponsored links work.Synchronous detection: The Query Intent detection is performed before Search, which allows to potentially modify or cancel the query, and/or perform other actions before Search is actually executed. This process is analogous to how the Did You Mean functionality works. Note that this process involves an additional round-trip with the Sinequa platform, so it slows down search a little bit.    Synchronous detection can be activated by setting the queryIntentsSync property of the SearchOptions in your AppModule:  @NgModule({ imports: [ ..., BsSearchModule.forRoot({queryIntentsSync: true})   The SearchService emits a new-query-intents event when results are in.

Let's say we have configured an intent named &quot;people&quot; on the backend. When we search for &quot;who is John Doe?&quot;, this intent matches and we can display an info-card about that person.  In our QueryIntentService let's add a method that looks for the &quot;people&quot; intent and fetches data about that person:   // People Query intent data person?: string; personData = new ReplaySubject&lt;Results|undefined&gt;(1); processPeople(event: SearchService.NewQueryIntentsEvent) { // Look for the &quot;people&quot; intent const people = event.intents.filter(intent =&gt; intent.name === &quot;people&quot;) .map(intent =&gt; intent.globalEntities?.[0]?.normalization as string) .filter(f =&gt; !!f); // If any (and if not already processed) if(people.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; this.person !== people[0]) { // Create a query for this person const query = this.searchService.makeQuery(); query.text = people[0]; query.action = &quot;aggregate&quot;; query.aggregations = [&quot;geo&quot;, &quot;company&quot;, &quot;person&quot;]; this.searchService.getResults(query) .subscribe(r =&gt; { this.person = people[0]; this.personData.next(r); // Emits the data for the infocard }); } // If none, we want to stop displaying the infocard, if any else if(people.length === 0) { this.person = undefined; this.personData.next(undefined); } }   We can call this method from the init() method we defined above.  Then, to display the infocard, we simply create a component that displays the personData, if any. This can be as simple as the following:  @Component({ selector: 'sq-query-intent-people', template: ` &lt;sq-facet-card *ngIf=&quot;queryIntentsService.personData | async; let results&quot; [title]=&quot;queryIntentsService.person&quot; [icon]=&quot;'fas fa-user'&quot;&gt; &lt;sq-facet-tag-cloud #facet [results]=&quot;results&quot; [aggregations]=&quot;['Company','Geo','Person']&quot;&gt; &lt;/sq-facet-tag-cloud&gt; &lt;/sq-facet-card&gt; ` }) export class QueryIntentPeopleComponent { constructor( public queryIntentsService: QueryIntentService ){} }   With the example above we display a tag-cloud with terms related to a person. This infocard can be displayed, for example, on the right side of the user interface. This component has no input, and it manages its own visibility, so it's enought to embed it with something as simple as:  &lt;sq-query-intent-people&gt;&lt;/sq-query-intent-people&gt;   Result of searching &quot;who is Barack Obama?&quot;  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Example 2: Automatic filters​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Query Intent Detection","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tipstricks/query-intent#example-2-automatic-filters","content":" Another use-case for Query Intent is to detect the intent of applying a specific filter. For example, if a user searches for &quot;earnings report pdf&quot;, we can detect that they really means &quot;earnings report&quot; and format = pdf.  Let's say we have configured an intent named &quot;format&quot; that detects a file format in the query. Now, since we want to modify the search query, we need to work in synchronous mode. So, in our AppModule, let's start by adding the queryIntentSync option, as explained above:  export const searchOptions: SearchOptions = { ..., queryIntentsSync: true };   In our QueryIntentService let's add a method that looks for the &quot;format&quot; intent, modifies the query, cancels the current search and performs a new query:   formats: string[]; processFormats(event: SearchService.NewQueryIntentsEvent) { // Activate only if user has not already created a docformat filter if(!event.query.findSelect(&quot;docformat&quot;)) { // Look for the &quot;format&quot; intents this.formats = event.intents.filter(intent =&gt; intent.name === &quot;format&quot;) .map(intent =&gt; intent.globalEntities?.[0]?.value.toLowerCase() as string) .filter(f =&gt; !!f); // If any... if(this.formats.length &gt; 0) { // Add a format filter to the query and remove the format from the searched text event.query.addSelect(this.exprBuilder.makeOrExpr(&quot;docformat&quot;, this.formats), &quot;docformat&quot;); for(let format of this.formats){ event.query.text = event.query.text?.replace(new RegExp(&quot;\\\\s*\\\\b&quot;+format+&quot;\\\\b\\\\s*&quot;, &quot;i&quot;), &quot; &quot;).trim(); } // Cancel the current search event.cancelSearch = true; // Create a new search this.searchService.search(); } } }   Notice that we cancel the current search and create a new one. This is not stricly mandatory, and it would also work to only modify the query. But the problem with that is that the URL would contain the old query, not the modified query. The URL would reflect the actual search parameters only on the next search, which is not very satisfying.  One limit of this type of Query Intent is that the user may have actually meant to search for the term &quot;pdf&quot;. Therefore, it is important to give them the possibility of forcing that search and ignoring the Query Intent. To do so, we can develop a component similar to the &quot;Did you mean&quot; component:  @Component({ selector: 'sq-query-intent-format', template: ` &lt;div *ngIf=&quot;queryIntentService.formats?.length&quot;&gt; Did you mean to filter by formats? &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; (click)=&quot;cancel()&quot;&gt;cancel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ` }) export class QueryIntentFormatComponent { constructor( public queryIntentService: QueryIntentService ){} cancel() { this.queryIntentService.cancelFormats(); return false; } }   This component is displayed only when the QueryIntentService has detected formats and modified the query. We just need to implement the cancelFormats() method on the service. This can be done in different ways, but in our case, let's assume we want to disable the format detection once and for all (until the app is reloaded):   ignoreFormat = false; cancelFormats() { // Remove the docformat selection this.searchService.query.removeSelect(&quot;docformat&quot;); // Put back the format name in the query text const text = this.searchService.query.text? [this.searchService.query.text] : []; this.searchService.query.text = text.concat(this.formats).join(&quot; &quot;); // Search again this.searchService.search(); // Set a flat to turn off format detection this.ignoreFormat = true; this.formats = []; } processFormats(event: SearchService.NewQueryIntentsEvent) { // Turn off the format detection in our existing processFormats() method if(!event.query.findSelect(&quot;docformat&quot;) &amp;&amp; !this.ignoreFormat) { ... } }   Result of searching &quot;code civil pdf&quot; ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Third-Party libraries","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tipstricks/thirdparty","content":"Third-Party libraries Adding third-party libraries to your SBA works just like with a regular Angular application.

However, as the CLI shields webpack from us, you need a custom builder.  Fortunately, the package @angular-architects/module-federation provides such a custom builder.  For the following example, let's assume the following naming : the host application as shell and the remote application as mfe (stands for Micro front-end).  To get started, you can just &quot;ng add&quot; the package to your projects:  ng add @angular-architects/module-federation --project shell --port 5000  ng add @angular-architects/module-federation --project mfe --port 3000  These commands activate module federation, assign a port for ng serve, and generate the skeleton of a module federation configuration (webpack.config.js).  ⚠️ NOTE: The webpack.config.js is only a partial webpack configuration. It only contains stuff to control module federation. The rest is generated by the CLI as usual ⚠️  Now let's jump onto the project mfe and edit the generated configuration in .../projects/mfe/webpack.config.js  const ModuleFederationPlugin = require(&quot;webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin&quot;); [...] module.exports = { [...], plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: &quot;mfe&quot;, filename: &quot;remoteEntry.js&quot;, exposes: { // The update './Module': './projects/mfe/src/app/toto/toto.module.ts', }, shared: { &quot;@angular/core&quot;: { singleton: true, strictVersion: true }, &quot;@angular/common&quot;: { singleton: true, strictVersion: true }, &quot;@angular/router&quot;: { singleton: true, strictVersion: true }, [...] } }), [...] ], };   This exposes the TotoModule under the name ./Module. Hence, the shell can use this path to load it.  To do so, you need to adjust the shell's generated configuration as follows :  const ModuleFederationPlugin = require(&quot;webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin&quot;); [...] module.exports = { [...], plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ // Make sure to use port 3000 defined on the first step while adding the package to the projects remotes: { 'mfe': &quot;mfe@http://localhost:3000/remoteEntry.js&quot; }, shared: { &quot;@angular/core&quot;: { singleton: true, strictVersion: true }, &quot;@angular/common&quot;: { singleton: true, strictVersion: true }, &quot;@angular/router&quot;: { singleton: true, strictVersion: true }, [...] } }), [...] ], };   This references the separately compiled and deployed mfe project.

It can be especially useful to fetch some required configuration from the server. The @sinequa/core library already injects a few initializers implicitly, but it is possible to add new ones. In particular, we provide a StartConfigInitializer to automatically fetch configuration from the Sinequa server (see Startup configuration). HTTP_INTERCEPTORS: An HTTP interceptor is a piece of code that hooks into the Angular HTTP client. It can &quot;intercept&quot; any request sent to the server, to perform some global actions. By default, three interceptors are injected: The LoginInterceptor takes care of triggering the authentication process when the server sends back a 401 error (Unauthorized). When the authentication is complete, the interceptor plays back the failed query. See Login methods.The AuditInterceptor takes care of normalizing the Audit event messages sent to the server via any web service call. It can be overridden to customize all the audit events across the app. See Auditing applications.The NotificationsInterceptor takes care of displaying notifications coming from the server (Notifications can be included via a $notifications array appended to the JSON response).

In Vanilla Search, the AppComponent does three important things:  In the controller (app.component.ts), notice that the component extends ComponentWithLogin. This parent component takes care of initiating the login process (calling LoginService.login() method). This means the login process is always initiated regardless of the active route.In the onLoginComplete() method, some initialization tasks are implemented (these tasks could only be performed post-login). In particular, the action bar's selectionActions are populated (in function of the features activated in the configuration).In the template (app.component.html) we include the &lt;router-outlet&gt; component. The role of the outlet is to display the currently active route. In vanilla the default route is the /home route, displaying the HomeComponent. Note that the route component is displayed even if the user is not logged in.  The Login process is described extensively in Login Methods. It is important to be aware that a common source of error is trying to perform some actions requiring to be logged in, without verifying whether or not it is the case. Because of point 3) above, it is very important to include checks in the applications, such as:  &lt;h1 *ngIf=&quot;loginService.complete&quot;&gt; Hello {{principalService.principal.fullName}}! &lt;/h1&gt;   It is also frequently required to perform tasks upon login or logout events.

The name of the identity provider is 'identity-dev'. In your hello-search/ project, open the src/app/app.module.ts file, and replace the placeholders parameters in the StartConfig object: export const startConfig: StartConfig = { app: &quot;training&quot;, autoSAMLProvider: &quot;identity-dev&quot;, production: environment.production, auditEnabled: true }; Notice that this startConfig object gets passed to the WebServiceModule from @sinequa/core. In fact, the forRoot() method adds this object to the list of providers, and Angular then injects it in all the web services (which then know the URL of the server and can send queries to it).

It may refer to a typescript module, which is in fact just a .ts file, which imports variables and types from other modules and exports other variables and types. In contrast, an Angular module is a class with a NgModule annotation, which also imports other NgModule and can export Angular components, directives and pipes.  Typescript module:  import { a } from './foo'; console.log(a); export const b = a + 42;   Angular module:  import { AnotherModule } from './foo'; @NgModule({ imports: [ AnotherModule ] }) export class MyModule {}   In this tutorial, we generally refer to the second type of modules (Angular modules).  Relationships between Angular modules (blue), components (purple) and their library (green)  Some of these modules are based on the Bootstrap library. When a module or component depends on Bootstrap, its class name is prefixed with Bs (eg. BsSearchModule, BsFacetList).  The tutorial is divided in chapters which each deals with a new Sinequa feature. These features come packaged as modules of the @sinequa/components library. The illustration below depicts in more details the content of a typical module/library which you will use in this tutorial.  Content of one of the libraries (green), including modules (blue), components (purple), services (red), styles (orange) and locales (grey)  This gives you a natural checklist for dealing with these modules:  Take a look at the code of that module in the @sinequa/components library. In this example, inside: projects/components/facet/. This gives you a general idea of what components, directives and services are bundled with that module. Import the module you're interested in in your app.module.ts: import { BsFacetModule } from '@sinequa/components/facet'; @NgModule({ imports: [ ..., BsFacetModule ], ... }) ... Use the components, directives and pipes in the templates of your app: &lt;sq-facet-list [results]=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/sq-facet-list&gt; Inject the services in the constructor(s) of your component(s): import { FacetService } from '@sinequa/components/facet'; ... export class MyComponent { constructor( public facetService: FacetService ){ ... } } Some libraries include a global stylesheet that needs to be imported so that the components are correctly displayed. Import these stylesheet in your global styles\\app.scss: @import &quot;../../../components/facet/bootstrap/facet.scss&quot;; Some components contain strings that need to be translated in various languages, to internationalize your SBA. We provide translations in three languages (English, French and German) via &quot;message files&quot; which your app needs to import. Alternatively, you can ignore these files and fully rewrite the messages in your app (which is needed anyway if you are going to add additional languages).

Replace these strings with message strings with the sqMessage pipe, and add the corresponding entries in your dictionary (locales/en.ts).

Add the router-outlet to app.component.html. You should have something like this (note that we positioned the notifications with position: fixed in the bottom right): app.component.html &lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt; &lt;button *ngIf=&quot;loginService.complete&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; (click)=&quot;logout()&quot;&gt;{{ msg#app.logout | sqMessage }}&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button *ngIf=&quot;!loginService.complete&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; (click)=&quot;login()&quot;&gt;{{ msg#app.login | sqMessage }}&lt;/button&gt; &lt;ng-container *ngIf=&quot;notificationsService.notificationsStream | async as notification&quot;&gt; &lt;div *ngIf=&quot;deleteNotification(notification)&quot; class=&quot;notification position-fixed&quot; style=&quot;bottom: 5px; right: 5px; width: 500px&quot;&gt; &lt;div *ngIf=&quot;notification.title&quot; class=&quot;title&quot;&gt; &lt;span&gt;{{notification.title | sqMessage}}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;{{notification.text | sqMessage:{values: notification.params} }}&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/ng-container&gt; In your app.module.ts, define two routes corresponding to our two new components: app.module.ts @NgModule({ imports: [ ... RouterModule.forRoot([ {path: &quot;home&quot;, component: HomeComponent}, {path: &quot;search&quot;, component: SearchComponent}, {path: &quot;**&quot;, redirectTo: &quot;home&quot;} ]), You should see: Open your search.component.html and migrate all the &lt;sq-search-form&gt; element to the search-form.component.html. Don't forget to add the SearchService dependency in the component's constructor. Remove the searchRoute input from &lt;sq-search-form&gt; since we now want the route to be &quot;search&quot;. Insert the new search form in the search.component.html, where the &lt;form&gt; used to be: search.component.html ... &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;app-search-form&gt;&lt;/app-search-form&gt; Also insert the search form in your home.component.html with a little formatting to make it look good: home.component.html &lt;div class=&quot;vh-100 w-100 d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center&quot;&gt; &lt;h1 class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Hello Search 🔍&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;w-50 position-relative mb-5&quot;&gt; &lt;app-search-form&gt;&lt;/app-search-form&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; This should now look like this: Modify the search() method in autocomplete.ts to also redirect on the &quot;search&quot; route: autocomplete.ts search() { ... this.searchService.searchText(&quot;/search&quot;); } When you perform a search, upon hitting Enter or clicking on an autocompletion suggestion, you are now indeed redirected to the &quot;search&quot; route, but the search result does not appear. To fix this, in your app.module.ts tell your Search module that search is a search route: app.module.ts BsSearchModule.forRoot({routes: ['search']}), At this point, your app should work, but once on the Search component, it is impossible to come back to the Home component. Let's add a router link on the &quot;Hello Search&quot; Title: &lt;a [routerLink]=&quot;['/home']&quot; class=&quot;mr-auto&quot;&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello Search 🔍&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/a&gt;   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Adding new routes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Routing","url":"/sba-angular/docs/tutorial/routing#adding-new-routes","content":" The refactoring above is relatively complicated because we decided to add routes to a single-component app. More realistically, your app would have multiple routes from the start.  Adding new routes to an existing SBA is fairly simple:  Create a new component (manually or with ng generate component as above)Wire the component to your routes in your app.module.ts, as in step 3. above.Then create links from you existing routes to the new route: Either via HTML, with a router link (as above in step 9)Or programmatically, using router.navigate() (which is what the SearchService is doing in step 7 above) If you want the SearchService to be active on your route (resolve search queries based on the URL), add the route to the list passed to the BsSearchModule (as in step 8 above). Note that the SearchService does not have to be tied to routing. You can deactivate that by passing a deactivateRouting: true parameter to the service, via the BsSearchModule.forRoot() method.
