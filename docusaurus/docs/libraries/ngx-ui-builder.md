# UI Builder

UI Builder (`ngx-ui-builder`) is an Angular library for creating no-code tools & applications.

The library is developped by Sinequa as a standalone project hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sinequa/ngx-ui-builder) and published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sinequa/ngx-ui-builder). It has a release cycle independent from the SBA framework, and it has its own [documentation page](https://sinequa.github.io/ngx-ui-builder/) and [demo application](https://sinequa.github.io/ngx-ui-builder/demo/).

The library is used in the [Vanilla Builder](../apps/5-vanilla-builder.md) application to let users customize the standard [Vanilla Search](../apps/2-vanilla-search.md) User Interface.

The goal of this library is to provide three functionalities:

1. The ability to make a User Interface re-configurable by drag-and-dropping its components into "containers" (supporting multiple levels of sub-containers, allowing for arbitrary UI layouts).
2. The ability to customize the configuration and styling of the components by clicking on them and editing their properties in a form (including helper components to generate forms easily).
3. The ability to save the configuration of the User Interface in a JSON format and to load it back later. The configuration can also be used to generate a "static" Angular application (where the components are in a fixed position and not configurable any more, like in a "normal" Angular application). This "export" is generated by running an [Angular schematic](https://github.com/sinequa/ngx-ui-builder#static-export) in the application workspace (passing the configuration as a JSON file).

Please refer to the [UI Builder documentation](https://sinequa.github.io/ngx-ui-builder/) for more details.
