# User Settings Modules

The User Settings modules are also documented in the [Tutorial](/tutorial/user-settings.md) and in the [Tips & Tricks](/tipstricks/user-settings.md) section.

Also check the documentation on the User Settings web service from the [Web Services library](/libraries/core/web-services.md#user-settings-web-service) (in the Core library).

## Features

There are currently five functionalities based on the User Settings. The table below summarizes the features available for each of them:

| Functionality | Library `@sinequa/components` | Service | CRUD API | Edit Modal | Manage Modal | User Menu | Facet |
|---------|---------|---------|:--------:|:----------:|:------------:|:---------:|:-----:|
| Saved Queries | `/saved-queries` | `SavedQueriesService` | ✓ |   | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Recent Queries | `/saved-queries` | `RecentQueriesService` | ✓ |   |   |   | ✓ |
| Recent Documents | `/saved-queries` | `RecentDocumentsService` | ✓ |   |   |   | ✓ |
| Baskets | `/baskets` | `BasketsService` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Alerts | `/alerts` | `AlertsService` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |   |

## Import

Import one or more module(s) in your `app.module.ts`.

```ts
import { BsSavedQueriesModule } from '@sinequa/components/saved-queries';
import { BsAlertsModule } from '@sinequa/components/alerts';
import { BsBasketsModule } from '@sinequa/components/baskets';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...
    BsSavedQueriesModule,
    BsAlertsModule,
    BsBasketsModule
```

These modules are internationalized: If not already the case, you need to import their messages for the language(s) of your application. For example, in your app's `src/locales/en.ts`:

```ts
...
import {enAlerts} from "@sinequa/components/alerts";
import {enBaskets} from "@sinequa/components/baskets";
import {enSavedQueries} from "@sinequa/components/saved-queries";

const messages = Utils.merge({}, ..., enAlerts, enBaskets, enSavedQueries, appMessages);
```

## Saved Queries

**Saved Queries** are a functionality that lets users save their current search criteria (which may include searched text, tabs and facets selections, etc.) to replay them later. These queries are given a name and can be displayed in a list (facet, or user menu).

### User Menu


The `sq-saved-queries-menu` component displays the list of saved queries, lets a user save his current query and allows to reorganize the list (See the *Manage* modal below).

![Saved queries menu](/assets/modules/user-settings/saved-queries-menu.png)

This menu is meant to be inserted in a Bootstrap-styled navbar:

```html
<ul class="navbar-nav">
    <sq-saved-queries-menu></sq-saved-queries-menu>
    <!-- Other menus -->
</ul>
```

### Facet


The `sq-facet-saved-queries` component displays the list of saved queries, lets a user re-play one of them, open the *Manage* modal (see below), or delete specific queries.

![Saved queries facet](/assets/modules/user-settings/saved-queries-facet.png)

This facet is meant to work with the `sq-facet-card` component (See [Facet Module](facet.md)):

```html
<sq-facet-card  [title]="'msg#savedQueries.savedQueries'"
                [tooltip]="'msg#home.savedQueriesTooltip'"
                [icon]="'fas fa-save'">
    <sq-facet-saved-queries #facet [maxQueries]="5"></sq-facet-saved-queries>
</sq-facet-card>
```

The component accepts the following (optional) inputs:

- `searchRoute` (default: `'/search'`): The route to navigate to when searching a query (clicked by the user).
- `maxQueries` (default: `5`): The maximum number of queries to display (the rest is available with pagination).
- `enableDelete` (default: `true`): Whether to enable the deletion of queries in the facet.

### Service & Modals

The `SavedQueriesService` is the access point for the list of saved queries (`SavedQueriesService.savedqueries`), and it provides a list of public methods to create, read, update and delete this data (CRUD API).

Additional methods allow to display modal dialogs:

- `createSavedQueryModal()` displays the `sq-edit-saved-query` modal component which prompts the user for a name (for the saved query)
- `manageSavedQueriesModal()` displays the `sq-manage-saved-queries` modal component which displays the list of queries and lets the user reorganize it (change the order, remove or rename elements)
- `exportModal()` displays the `sq-export-query` modal component which allows to export a saved query or a list of results.

## Recent Queries

**Recent Queries** are a functionality that records the latest queries of the user in the User Settings. These queries can then be displayed (eg. in a facet), or used in other ways (eg. autocomplete).

### Facet


The `sq-facet-recent-queries` component displays the list of recent queries and lets a user re-play, delete or save one of them.

![Recent queries facet](/assets/modules/user-settings/recent-queries-facet.png)

This facet is meant to work with the `sq-facet-card` component (See [Facet Module](facet.md)):

```html
<sq-facet-card  [title]="'msg#facet.recentQueries.title'"
                [tooltip]="'msg#home.recentQueriesTooltip'"
                [icon]="'fas fa-history'">
    <sq-facet-recent-queries #facet [maxQueries]="5"></sq-facet-recent-queries>
</sq-facet-card>
```

The component accepts the following (optional) inputs:

- `searchRoute` (default: `'/search'`): The route to navigate to when searching a query (clicked by the user).
- `maxQueries` (default: `5`): The maximum number of queries to display (the rest is available with pagination).
- `enableDelete` (default: `true`): Whether to enable the deletion of queries in the facet.
- `enableSave` (default: `true`): Whether to enable saving a recent query in the facet.

### Service

The `RecentQueriesService` is the access point for the list of recent queries (`RecentQueriesService.recentqueries`), and it provides a list of public methods to create, read, update and delete this data (CRUD API).

## Recent Documents

**Recent Documents** are a functionality that records the latest documents opened by the user in the User Settings. This list of documents can then be displayed (eg. in a facet), or used in other ways (eg. autocomplete).

### Facet


The `sq-facet-recent-documents` component displays the list of recent document and lets a user re-open one, or remove it from the list.

![Recent documents facet](/assets/modules/user-settings/recent-documents-facet.png)

This facet is meant to work with the `sq-facet-card` component (See [Facet Module](facet.md)):

```html
<sq-facet-card  [title]="'msg#savedQueries.savedQueries'"
                [tooltip]="'msg#home.savedQueriesTooltip'"
                [icon]="'fas fa-save'">
    <sq-facet-recent-documents #facet [maxDocuments]="5"></sq-facet-recent-documents>
</sq-facet-card>
```

The component accepts the following (optional) inputs:

- `maxDocuments` (default: `5`): The maximum number of documents to display (the rest is available with pagination).
- `enableDelete` (default: `true`): Whether to enable the deletion of documents from the list.
- `openOriginal` (default: `false`): Whether to open the original document (`record.url1`) when clicked, or simply emit an event (`(documentOpened)` event emitter).

### Service

The `RecentDocumentsService` is the access point for the list of recent documents (`RecentDocumentsService.recentdocuments`), and it provides a list of public methods to create, read, update and delete this data (CRUD API).

## Alerts

**Alerts** are a functionality that lets a user schedule and subscribe to a search alert (which will regularly inform them of new relevant content). These alerts can then be displayed (eg. in a user menu), edited (*Edit* modal) and reorganized (*Manage* modal).

### User Menu


The `sq-alerts-menu` component displays the list of alerts, lets a user schedule an alert for the current query and allows to reorganize the list (See the *Manage* modal below).

![Alerts menu](/assets/modules/user-settings/alerts-menu.png)

This menu is meant to be inserted in a Bootstrap-styled navbar:

```html
<ul class="navbar-nav">
    <sq-alerts-menu></sq-alerts-menu>
    <!-- Other menus -->
</ul>
```

### Service & Modals

The `AlertsService` is the access point for the list of alerts (`AlertsService.Alerts`), and it provides a list of public methods to create, read, update and delete this data (CRUD API).

Additional methods allow to display modal dialogs:

- `createAlertModal()` displays the `sq-edit-alert` modal component which lets the user create and schedule an alert.
- `editAlertModal()` displays the `sq-edit-alert` modal component (same as above) which allows to edit the parameters of an existing alert.
- `manageAlertsModal()` displays the `sq-manage-alerts` modal component which displays the list of alerts and lets the user reorganize it (change the order, remove or rename elements). This component is similar to the `sq-manage-saved-queries` component.

## Baskets

**Baskets** (a.k.a *Bookmarks* or *Collections*) are a functionality that lets users store specific documents to retrieve them later. A basket is essentially a named list of document ids (the document is only referenced, not copied).

Note: in [Vanilla Search](../../apps/vanilla-search), Baskets are actually renamed "Collections" (via internationalization).

### User Menu

The `sq-baskets-menu` component displays the list of baskets, lets a user create a new basket and reorganize the list (See the *Manage* modal below).

This menu is meant to be inserted in a Bootstrap-styled navbar.

<doc-baskets-menu></doc-baskets-menu>

### Facet

The `sq-facet-baskets` component displays the list of baskets, lets a user open one of them, create a new one, open the *Manage* modal (see below), and delete specific baskets.

This facet is meant to work with the `sq-facet-card` component (See [Facet Module](facet.md)).

<doc-facet-baskets></doc-facet-baskets>

The component accepts the following (optional) inputs:

- `searchRoute` (default: `'/search'`): The route to navigate to when opening a basket (clicked by the user).
- `maxBaskets` (default: `5`): The maximum number of baskets to display (the rest is available with pagination).
- `enableDelete` (default: `true`): Whether to enable the deletion of baskets in the facet.

### Service & Modals

The `BasketsService` is the access point for the list of baskets (`BasketsService.baskets`), and it provides a list of public methods to create, read, update and delete this data (CRUD API).

Additional methods allow to display modal dialogs:

- `addToBasketModal()` displays the `sq-select-basket` modal component which lets the user select a basket. The input document is then added to that basket.
- `removeFromBasketModal()` performs the same action as `addToBasketModal()` but removes the document from that basket.
- `createBasketModal()` displays the `sq-edit-basket` modal component which allows to create a basket after giving it a name.
- `manageBasketsModal()` displays the `sq-manage-baskets` modal component which displays the list of baskets and lets the user reorganize it (change the order, remove or rename elements). This component is similar to the `sq-manage-saved-queries` component.
