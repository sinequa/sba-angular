# Autocomplete Module

The Autocomplete module is also documented in the [tutorial](/docs/tutorial/autocomplete.md).

## Features

### Standard features

This module provides functionality to display an autocomplete dropdown panel under a search form:

- A **directive** applied to the form's `<input>` to listen to user inputs, send autocomplete queries and process the results.
- A **service** that sends the autocomplete queries to the backend server and provides additional services.
- A **component** that displays these results (styled with the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library).

Both the directive and the component are largely extensible and customizable (See [Vanilla Search](../../apps/vanilla-search)).

Schematically, the code looks as follow:

```html
<form>

    <input type="text" sqAutocomplete [dropdown]="mydropdown">

    <button type="submit">Search</button>

    <sq-autocomplete-list #mydropdown>
        <ng-template #itemTpl let-item>
            {{ item.display }}
        </ng-template>
    </sq-autocomplete-list>

</form>
```

## Import

Import this module in your `app.module.ts`.

```ts
import { BsAutocompleteModule } from '@sinequa/components/autocomplete';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...
    BsAutocompleteModule
```

## Standard Autocomplete

### Autocomplete Directive

The `sqAutocomplete` directive (applied to the `<input>` element) listens to user interactions (keyboard inputs, mouse inputs, blur and focus events), sends autocomplete queries to the backend (via the `SuggestService`) and controls the dropdown component (what to display, when to display it and what to do when an item is selected).

The directive has several inputs:

- `dropdown`: A reference to the dropdown component. This component is not necessarily `sq-autocomplete-list`, but it needs to implement the `AutocompleteComponent` interface.
- `suggestQuery`: The name of the "Suggest Query" configured on the server. This value can be hard-coded, or provided by via the `AppService.suggestQueries` list (post-login).
- `off` (default: `false`): Whether the directive is turned off or not.
- `suggestDelay` (default: `200`): Number of milliseconds between queries sent to the server.
- `placeholder` (default: `''`): Placeholder to display when no text is written in the input.

It also provides the following outputs (Event emitters):

- `stateChange`: Emits the state of the autocomplete (`OFF`, `INIT`, `START`, `ACTIVE`, `OPENED`, `SELECTED`)
- `submit`: Fires when the users "submits" the query (by typing Enter)

Of course, other attributes and directives may be applied along with the `sqAutocomplete` directive. For example we may have the following:

```html
<input type="text"
    formControlName="search"
    class="form-control"
    spellcheck="false"
    autocomplete="off"

    [sqAutofocus]="autofocus"

    sqAutocomplete
    [placeholder]="'msg#searchForm.searchFor' | sqMessage"
    [dropdown]="dropdown"
    [off]="!loginService.complete || !appService.suggestQueries"
    [suggestQuery]="appService.suggestQueries? appService.suggestQueries[0] : ''"
    (submit)="search()">
```

You can customize the behavior of the directive by extending it and enriching it. The following methods can be overridden:

- `getSuggests()`: Takes the text typed by the user to get suggestions (via `getSuggestsObs()`) and pass them to `processSuggests()`. This method can be overridden to modify the text read in the input element and passed to `getSuggestObs()`.
- `getSuggestsObs()`: Makes a call to the `SuggestService` to obtain suggestions (which are then passed to `processSuggests()`). It can be overridden to obtain suggestions in a different way (this is the case in [Vanilla Search](../../apps/vanilla-search)).
- `processSuggests(items)`: Update the dropdown component with the suggestions. This method can be overridden to post process or filters the suggestions before they are displayed.
- `select(item)` or `setAutocompleteItem(item)`: Methods called when an item is selected from the dropdown panel (either with the mouse or keyboard navigation). By default, the `<input>` text is set to the value of the autocomplete item, but other behavior can be implemented (opening a document, searching a custom query, etc.; this is the case in [Vanilla Search](../../apps/vanilla-search))
- State change methods: `init()`, `start()`, `active()`, `open()`, `select()`. They can be overridden to insert new states or execute some custom code in specific states.

The transition between the different states is depicted below:

![Autocomplete states](/assets/modules/autocomplete/autocomplete-states.png)

### Suggest Service

The `SuggestService` provides the following methods:

- `get(suggestQuery: string, text: string, fields?: string | string[], query?: Query, maxCount = 10): Observable<ScoredAutocompleteItem<undefined,string>[]>`:

    This method uses both `SuggestQueryWebService` and `SuggestFieldWebService` to obtain suggestions from the server. It combines actual suggestions from suggest queries with suggestions of fields (when fielded search is active).

- `async searchData<T, Tcat extends string>(category: Tcat, query: string, data: T[], primaryText: (obj:T) => string, secondaryText?: (obj:T) => string[], label?: string) : Promise<ScoredAutocompleteItem<T, Tcat>[]>`:

    This method allows to search within a list of objects of any type (`T`). It is useful to search within a small number of user objects on the client side. For example, in [Vanilla Search](../../apps/vanilla-search), it is used to search within the recent queries, recent documents, saved queries and baskets.

    It expects the following inputs:

    1. `category`: The name of the `AutocompleteItem` category to be created as a result of this search.
    2. `query`: The text you want to search for.
    3. `data`: The list of objects you want to search in.
    4. `primaryText`: A function that takes in an object and outputs the primary text field to search in (eg. if objects are records, the primary field could be the title).
    5. `secondaryText` (optional): A function that takes in an object and outputs a list of secondary text fields to search in.
    6. `label` (optional): The label of the `AutocompleteItem` category to be created as a result of this search.

### Autocomplete List Component


The `sq-autocomplete-list` component is a fairly simple component that displays the list of suggestions from the directive. This component expects a `ng-template` named `#itemTpl` to be passed by transclusion, to actually display the items:

```html
<sq-autocomplete-list #mydropdown>
    <ng-template #itemTpl let-item>
        {{ item.display }}
    </ng-template>
</sq-autocomplete-list>
```

In the [Vanilla Search](../../apps/vanilla-search) application, the template (in [search-form.component.html](https://github.com/sinequa/sba-angular/blob/master/projects/vanilla-search/src/app/search-form/search-form.component.html)) looks like this:

```html
<ng-template #itemTpl let-item>
    <div class="autocomplete-item p-2">
        <i class="{{autocompleteIcon(item.category)}}"></i><!--
        --><span class="mx-2" [innerHTML]="item.displayHtml || item.display"></span><!--
        --><small *ngIf="item.category" class="autocomplete-category ml-2">{{(item.label || item.category) | sqMessage}}</small>
    </div>
</ng-template>
```

You can customize the component by customizing the content of`#itemTpl`. Note that `item` is an `AutocompleteItem` passed by the directive.

You can also write you own component entirely, as long as:

- You tag it and pass it to the directive (`#mydropdown` in the example above).
- Your component implements the `AutocompleteComponent` interface. This interface requires you to implement the following methods:
  - `hasItems(boolean)`: Whether there are any item to display
  - `clicked(EventEmitter<AutocompleteItem>)`: Event emitter for clicks on an autocomplete item
  - `selectedValue(AutocompleteItem)`: The currently selected item, if any
  - `update(active: boolean, items?: AutocompleteItem[])`: Method called to pass data to this component. If `active==false`, the component should be closed.
  - `selectNext()`: Select and return the next `AutocompleteItem` in the list.
  - `selectPrevious()`: Select and return the previous `AutocompleteItem` in the list.

## Server-side configuration

The autocomplete functionality is built on top of two web services of the Sinequa REST API:

- Suggest Query Web Service (`api/v1/suggestquery`)
- Suggest Field Web Service (`api/v1/suggestfield`)

### Suggest Query Web Service

The Suggest Query web service uses a **Suggestion Query** configured on the Sinequa server to generate suggestions. These queries can be created and managed in the Sinequa administration, under *Search-Based Applications > App Dependencies > Suggestion Queries*.

![Suggest query](/assets/modules/autocomplete/suggest-query.png)
*Standard configuration of a Suggestion Query*


A suggestion query is associated to a **Suggestion Lexicon**. The lexicon contains all the terms which can be used as suggestions. These terms are generated from the index content, and each one belongs in a **"kind"** (by default the kind just corresponds to the name of the column from which the term is extracted).

![Suggest lexicon](/assets/modules/autocomplete/lexicon.png)
*Configuration of a suggestion lexicon*


The "kind" (or "category") is important, as it is used in fielded search to request suggestions for a specific field. For example, when autocompleting the field `company`, we do not want *any* kind of suggestion: We want only suggestions belonging to the "company" kind / category.

⚠️ Be careful, as there are typically some differences the between the column names defined in the suggest lexicon and the field names used in your SBA, because of **aliases**. If you define an alias for the field "company" (and you want this field to be autocompleted), it might be a good idea to use the same alias for the "kind" of this column in the lexicon.

### Suggest Field Web Service

When we request the Suggest Query web service for a specific "kind", but no results are returned, the Suggest Field Web Service is used as a fallback.

The Suggest Field web service does not use a lexicon to create suggestions. Instead, it directly queries the engine for data, using a **distribution**, and using the `prefixes` option to filter the searched text. If you search suggestions for the field `person`, the requests look as follow:

```sql
SELECT DISTRIBUTION('person,count=100,basicforms=true,order2=labelasc,labels=true,prefixes="Barack Oba",caseinsensitive=true') AS dist FROM index WHERE <security clause> AND entity17 CONTAINS 'Barack Oba*' COUNT 1
```

There are various benefits to this approach:

- The data is always up-to-date. No need to refresh a lexicon.
- This service is built-in and has no configuration attached.
- We can search in the context of a **query** (adding to the `WHERE` clause), which means the data is more relevant and secured.
- Also note that unlike the Suggest Query web service, this service resolves SBA aliases. (So if you defined an alias for the field `person`, the service knows it should actually request the engine for the `person` column).

However, this approach means more requests are sent to the engine, which can hinder performance. Also, the completion is limited to a simple prefix approach, unlike the Suggest queries and lexicons which have many options to manage more complex completion strategies.
